<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The best kind of American woman is proud. She has
confidence in herself. She is not vain or conceited or self-assertive,
but she has faith in her own powers. Even if
she could, she would not spend her life in play or in idleness;
she would choose to work. She believes that because
she is doing her chosen work&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;steadily,
hour by hour, day by day, she is achieving.
Because she has confidence in herself, she can live and
labor serenely, proudly. No matter how obscure her lot,
she feels herself to be in the same class as the most famous
of her American sisters who have worked with steadiness
and confidence at their task, and who have achieved
greatness.</p>

<p>So difficult has it been for teachers to find brief, readable
biographies of distinguished women to use in connection
with their lessons in history and civics that they will welcome
this interesting collection. It should help to make
the girls in our American schools proud of their womanhood
and it should give them a strong desire to be worthy of
belonging to the same class as this group of noble workers.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The advantages of biography as a means of education
are obvious. History and biography go hand in hand, the
latter giving vitality and reality to the former.</p>

<p>Educators have for a long time appreciated this, and in
many Courses of Study throughout our land provision
has been made for the teaching of history through biography.
In most cases, emphasis has been laid upon the
notable careers of Washington, Franklin, Lincoln, and
other illustrious men, with the purpose of interesting the
young and inspiring in them the spirit of emulation.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that little attention, if any, has
been given to the study of the careers of distinguished
women, and the question has often been asked why short
biographies should not be prepared, in order that the pupils
in our schools might become familiar with the noble
and unselfish lives of the many remarkable women whose
influence has been inspiring and uplifting. It is hoped
that those who read the stories of the lives of the women
whose names appear in this volume will find in them
an incentive to guide their own lives into useful channels.</p>

<p>These types have been selected because of their direct
influence upon events of world-wide significance. Only
a limited number of types has been given because it
would be impossible, within the compass of one volume or
of many, to record the great and good deeds of women,
past and present.</p>

<p>The compiler has no intention of expressing her personal
opinions; the facts of these women's lives speak for
themselves, and the stories, necessarily brief here, of their
careers are so full of vital and human interest that it is
hoped that the young reader may be led to the perusal of
more complete biographies in later life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>
<p>Many foreign born girls in our schools have practically
no means of acquiring any adequate idea of the ideal
standard of American womanhood&mdash;a standard radically
different from that in their own native lands. The
foreign born boys, however, invariably study the lives
of great American men, and thus have no difficulty in
familiarizing themselves with high ideals in ethics and
statesmanship at precisely the time when the most enduring
impressions are being made. As there is no reason
whatever for this disparity of opportunity, it should cease,
and by means of this little work and others of similar
character, our school girls in general&mdash;and more especially
those of foreign birth or parentage&mdash;should be made
acquainted with the traditions and responsibilities of
American women, and the unlimited opportunities for
development and progress in this great Republic.</p>

<p>Women have been important factors in our national
growth, and the value of their aid in carrying forward the
progress of human improvement has never been properly
estimated. The future of woman in America is undoubtedly
to be of still greater significance to our country. Every
art and profession is open to her, everything compatible with
womanhood is within her reach, and she should be in readiness
for the supreme civic privilege if such be granted her.</p>

<p>To-day, women are voting in ten states of the Union,
a fact which calls attention to the necessity of educating
girls for the duties of citizenship. The woman of the
future will be better equipped to meet such duties by the
study of the lives of certain representative women.</p>

<p>In the schools, side by side with boys, our girls study
civics. Side by side with boys, they salute the Flag.
Grown to womanhood, still side by side with men, they
will help to uphold all the sacred traditions for which our
Flag stands,&mdash;the true woman never forgetting that the
home and the family are the bulwarks of the country.</p>

<h2><a name="JOAN_OF_ARC" id="JOAN_OF_ARC"></a>JOAN OF ARC</h2>

<p class="center">(1410, 1412-1431)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Oh child of France! Shepherdess, peasant girl! Trodden under
foot by all around thee, how I honor thy flashing intellect,
quick as God's lightning, and true as God's lightning to its
mark, that ran before France and laggard Europe by many a
century, confounding the malice of the ensnarer, and making
dumb the oracles of falsehood!"</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>De Quincey</em></p>
</div>


<p>The story of the life of Joan of Arc is so unusual
and so wonderful that it would be difficult to believe
it to be true, if all that happened to her had not been
told in a court of law and written down during her
lifetime. Few facts in history come to us so directly,
for these old records are still preserved in France,
where they may be seen and read to-day.</p>

<p>Joan was born sometime between 1410 and 1412,
in the little village of Domr&#233;my, France, being the
fifth child of Jacques and Isabelle d'Arc. Her parents
were peasants in comfortable circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>and Joan did not suffer through poverty. She never
learned to read or write&mdash;indeed, very few people
at that time were able to do so&mdash;but she became
skillful in the use of the needle and helped her mother
in all the household tasks. She was always good and
obedient to her parents and kind to every one,
especially the sick and the poor.</p>

<p>When work for the day was over, Joan ran about
with her playmates, full of fun and frolic, dancing and
singing for the pure joy of living. Often the children
would run to the beautiful forest near the village,
where there was an oak which they called the fairy
tree. Here they would bring cakes for little feasts, at
which they would dance, hanging garlands of flowers
on the branches in honor of the good fairies. This
was a custom of peasant children of France in those
days.</p>

<p>Joan would sometimes steal away from her companions
and sit quietly and thoughtfully alone. For
she was living in a very unhappy time for France,
and the misfortunes of her beloved country weighed
upon her spirits.</p>

<p>Her father had told her of the sad condition of
France, of how the kings of England had been for
nearly a hundred years trying to make themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>kings of France, and how, little by little, they had
taken possession of French lands until it was feared
they would soon own the entire country and France
would have an English king. Charles, called the
Dauphin, son of the old French king, did not dare to
be crowned, and no prince was thought to become
really king of France until that ceremony had taken
place. For centuries, the French kings had been
crowned and anointed with sacred oil at the Cathedral
of Rheims, but as the city of Rheims was far
away and in the power of the English, Charles
thought he could not safely go there.</p>

<p>As Joan grew older, she spent much of her time
alone and in prayer, brooding over the wrongs of her
country. She implored God to have pity on France.
When about thirteen years of age, and while she was
standing in her father's garden at noon one summer
day, she suddenly saw a great light and heard voices
telling her to be good, and telling her, also, that she
must go to the rescue of her country. Joan said that
she was only a young, ignorant peasant girl, who
could neither ride a horse nor use a sword. But the
voices kept on speaking to her for years, always telling
her the same thing, to go to the relief of the Dauphin.</p>

<p>Joan at last came to believe that the visions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>the voices came from God, and she determined to
obey them. When she told her father and mother
what she intended to do, they tried to dissuade her,
telling her that the voices she heard were imaginary,
and that it was impossible for a girl to do what
trained military men and great generals had failed
to accomplish. Though it was very hard for her to
act contrary to the wishes of her parents, Joan said
she must do the work God had planned for her.
Soon her gentle persistence had its effect, and people
stopped laughing at her and ridiculing her, some even
beginning to believe in her mission.</p>

<p>The voices bade Joan go to the Dauphin, who was
then living at Chinon, a castle on the Loire, and tell
him that she had come to lead his army to victory
and that he would shortly go to Rheims to be
crowned.</p>

<p>At first it seemed impossible for her to get to
Chinon, but she went to Vaucouleurs, where her uncle
lived, and with his help she succeeded in persuading
Robert de Baudricourt, the commander there, to
give her an escort of a few armed men for the
journey. Someone gave her a beautiful war-horse,
which, to the surprise of all, she rode well, though she
had never ridden before in her life. She cut her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>long, black hair short and dressed herself in doublet
and hose like a boy, and this costume she wore during
the remainder of her life.</p>

<p>On February 23, 1429, she rode out of Vaucouleurs
through a gate which is standing to-day, and after
several days journeying came to Chinon. Here there
was some delay, for Charles was surrounded by people
who advised him not to grant Joan an interview, but
she was finally permitted to enter the great hall of
the castle, where crowds of men, knights, and nobles in
gorgeous attire, were assembled. But Joan was not
dismayed. With confidence, but also with modesty,
she walked up to one who was very plainly dressed,
and fell on one knee before him saying, "God send you
long life, gentle Dauphin." The man pointed to
another, richly dressed in gold and silk embroidery,
saying, "That is the King." But Joan said, "No,
fair Sir!" She was not to be deceived, and her
recognition of Charles, notwithstanding his disguise,
caused all to wonder and many to believe in her.</p>

<p>The King asked her name and what she wanted.</p>

<p>"Fair Dauphin, my name is Jeanne the Maid;
and the King of Heaven speaks unto you by me, saying
that you shall be anointed and crowned at
Rheims," Joan replied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>She then asked to be allowed to lead his army to
the relief of Orleans, which city was under siege by
the English at that time, telling him that under her
guidance the victory would be theirs. Many of the
nobles laughed at the idea of a girl leading an army,
but after talking with her, Charles granted her request
and sent her to Tours, where preparations
were made for the journey to Orleans.</p>

<p>At length all was in readiness and the start was
made. On a bright spring day, Joan rode away from
Tours at the head of the King's army, wearing
beautiful armor of white wrought iron. She carried
an ancient sword, which she had divined was hidden
behind the altar of St. Catherine in the chapel at
Fierbois, and a banner embroidered with golden
lilies. Such a sight was never seen before nor
since.</p>

<p>It was night, April 29, when the French reached
Orleans. They had safely passed an English fortress
and entered the town without trouble. The people
of Orleans, carrying torches, crowded around Joan,
eager to see the brave girl who had come to their
rescue. The women tried to kiss her hands and all
the people shouted and cheered. The entire city
rejoiced, for Joan's calm confidence, her bravery and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>decision, inspired the soldiers with belief in her and
in the success of her undertaking.</p>

<p>Very soon Joan led her soldiers forth against the
English and they were successful in taking several
forts. She had prophesied long before this time
that she would be wounded during the fighting, and
one evening, shortly before the siege was raised, she
said to Brother Pasquerel, the priest who was with
her, "To-morrow rise even earlier than to-day. Stay
always at my side, for to-morrow I shall have much
ado&mdash;more than I have ever had, and to-morrow
blood shall flow from my body."</p>

<p>The next day, while placing a ladder against a wall
during the thick of the fight, a cross-bow entered her
shoulder in spite of her armor and blood flowed.
The arrow was drawn out and the wound was dressed,
whereupon she insisted upon returning to the battle,
though it is said she cried a little because of the pain.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock that night one of Joan's generals
came to her for permission to stop the fighting until
morning. But Joan asked him to wait a while.
Then she rode into a vineyard and prayed. When
she returned to the field, she found that a soldier had
carried her banner into a ditch. She seized it, and
waving it so that all the men saw it, cried, "When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>my standard touches the wall, we shall take the fort!"
Soon the wind blew the fringe of the banner against
the wall and with a mad rush the French climbed into
the fort, while the English fled.</p>

<p>The next day, May 8, 1429, the siege was raised,
and ever since, the people of Orleans celebrate that
day and pay honor to Joan, called by them "The
Maid of Orleans."</p>

<p>Several other victories were won by the French
under Joan's leadership until the English were driven
far to the North. Then Joan tried to induce Charles
to go to Rheims to be crowned, so that the French
people would feel that he was really their King.
But the distance was great and the roads passed
through towns which were occupied by friends of
the English, and Charles, who loved his ease, was
hard to move. At length, however, he was persuaded,
and with an army of twelve thousand men
Charles started on his journey to Rheims, which
city he entered on July 16, being crowned the next
day with imposing ceremonies.</p>

<p>This was perhaps the happiest day of Joan's life.
The great Cathedral was crowded with people, only
the center aisle being kept free for the procession.
First came the Archbishop, accompanied by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>canons in their robes of state. Then came men of
high rank, magnificently dressed. From the west
door Joan and the King appeared side by side, and
cheers and cries of welcome greeted them, followed by
a deep silence preceding the solemnity of the coronation.
The Archbishop of Rheims administered the
coronation oath; then the Dauphin was anointed
with the sacred oil, and crowned, while the trumpeters
played and the people shouted. The Maid
knelt at the King's feet and wept for joy.</p>

<p>When asked by Charles to choose a gift as a reward
for her work for her country, she begged that the
people of her native town Domr&#233;my might be free
from paying taxes. This was granted, and for three
hundred years the taxes were remitted. On the
books is written against the town of Domr&#233;my:
"Nothing. For the sake of the Maid."</p>

<p>This was all Joan would accept. For herself she
desired nothing except to be allowed to go back to her
village home to tend her sheep and be again with
her mother. But Charles <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr> would not consent to
that, for France was not yet free from the English.</p>

<p>So it was decided to try to recapture Paris. Shameful
to say, however, the King did not give Joan
the assistance he should, withdrawing instead from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>the city. Soon afterwards, while leading an attack
against the Duke of Burgundy, Joan was taken
prisoner and sold to the English. King Charles
made no effort to effect a ransom for her, nor did anyone
else in France attempt to raise money to save her
from her unhappy fate. She was charged with
sorcery, put into prison in Rouen, and after a year
was brought to trial. At the trial she was found
guilty, was sentenced to death, and burned at the
stake in the market place of Rouen, May 30, 1431.</p>

<p>Joan of Arc had no grave; her ashes were thrown
into the Seine. There remains no relic of her, no
portrait, or any article she ever touched. Still she
will never be forgotten. It is now nearly five hundred
years since her death, yet to-day she is honored
and reverenced, and many statues have been erected
to her memory.</p>

<p>A mere child in years, she rescued her country
from the English by a series of brilliant victories,
crowned the French king, and in return for this was
burned alive at the stake, while those for whom she
had fought looked on, making no effort to save her.
She was seventeen years of age when she led the
armies of France to victory, and but nineteen when
she met her cruel death.</p>

<p>Her pure, steadfast, simple faith, together with her
devotion to God and her patriotism, constitute her
greatness. During her life in camp, in Court, in
her home, and in prison, she never forgot her womanly
ideals, though she was called upon to do a man's
work; and she stands to-day to all nations a shining
example of pure and noble womanhood.</p>

<h2><a name="DOROTHY_PAYNE_MADISON" id="DOROTHY_PAYNE_MADISON"></a>DOROTHY PAYNE MADISON</h2>

<p class="center">(1772-1849)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is by woman that Nature writes on the hearts of men."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Richard Brinsley Sheridan</em></p>
</div>


<p>Dollie Madison was born May 27, 1772, in North
Carolina. Her father, John Payne, was a native
of Virginia, but he lived on a large plantation in
North Carolina which had been given him by his
father. He married Mary Coles, a noted belle and
beauty, and their daughter Dorothy inherited her
mother's good looks.</p>

<p>In their home on the Southern plantation, the
Paynes avoided all display, although they enjoyed
every comfort and were generous in hospitality.
The little Dorothy was brought up to dress quietly
and wear no finery. After their removal to Philadelphia,
which occurred when Dorothy was fourteen
years of age, both John Payne and his wife, already
Quakers, became more strict in that creed than they
had been before. It was Mr. Payne's conviction&mdash;as
it was of all Quakers in good and regular standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>&mdash;that
slavery was sinful, and this belief led him to
free his slaves, sell his plantation and come North.</p>

<p>In their Northern home, the Quaker rules were
rigidly carried out. Though young and of a particularly
gay and joyous disposition, Dorothy&mdash;or
"Dollie" as her friends called her&mdash;was forbidden
such pleasures as dancing, music, and many other
amusements. All this discipline, which we should
call unnatural, Dollie received with sweetness and
cheerfulness. Her beautiful face reflected a beautiful
character.</p>

<p>Mr. Payne, who was untrained in business ways,
met with financial reverses, and in his troubles was
aided by a young lawyer of wealth named John Tod,
also a member of the Society of Friends. This young
man, who had fallen in love with Dollie, showed Mr.
Payne much kindness, finally obtaining his consent
to ask his daughter's hand in marriage. When he
proposed to Dorothy, however, she replied that she
"never meant to marry." But her father was ill at
the time, and to please him, Dorothy, like the dutiful
daughter she had always been, consented, and so had
the satisfaction of making her father happy for the
remaining few months of his life.</p>

<p>After her marriage, Dollie lived for three years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>the life of a Quaker matron, devoting herself to her
husband, her home, and her two babies. Then an
epidemic of yellow fever broke out, and John Tod
sent Dollie and the babies away from the city while
he remained to look after his parents, who were both
dying of the fever.</p>

<p>As soon as he could leave, and already ill, he hastened
to his wife and children. Mrs. Payne, Dollie's
mother, opened the door for him. "I feel the fever
in my veins," he gasped, "but I must see her once
more!" In a few hours, he and one of the babies
were dead. Dollie herself was then stricken, and
fatally, it was believed. She recovered, however,
and taking with her the remaining child, a boy whom
she had named John Payne after her father, Dollie
went to her mother in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>These sad experiences broadened and deepened
her lovely nature so that she developed from a
shy girl into an attractive woman. Her troubles
seemed only to increase the natural sweetness of her
disposition and enhance her beauty. These gifts,
together with her youth and riches, caused her to
become the object of much curiosity and attention.</p>

<p>On a certain morning during her walk, she was
seen by James Madison, who immediately sought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>for an introduction. This undoubtedly flattered
Dollie, for Mr. Madison was a very prominent and
important figure in Congress, with a name celebrated
throughout Europe and America. He had worked
with Washington, Franklin, and Hamilton to establish
the United States government on a firm basis,
so that he has since been called the Father of the
Constitution.</p>

<p>In a letter to her friend Mrs. Lee, Dollie wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:</p>

<p>Thou must come to me. Aaron Burr says that the
"great-little Madison" has asked to be brought to see me
this evening....</p></div>

<p>When he came, Mrs. Tod received him in a fine
mulberry satin gown, with silk tulle about her neck
and a dainty lace cap on her head, a curl of her pretty
black hair showing from underneath. She so sparkled
with fun and wit that the scholarly Mr. Madison
concluded that there was nothing to do but to offer
himself as a husband, and before long they became
engaged.</p>

<p>President and Mrs. Washington were much pleased
when they heard of this and sent for Dollie to come
to them. Mrs. Washington said, "Be not ashamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>to confess it, if it is so," for Dollie was shy and confused.
Then she added,</p>

<p>"He will make thee a good husband and all the
better for being so much older. We both approve
of it. The esteem and friendship existing between
Mr. Madison and my husband is very great and we
would wish thee to be happy."</p>

<p>Dollie was just twenty-two years of age and Mr.
Madison forty-four. In September, 1794, at Harewood,
Virginia, the home of Dollie's sister who had
become the wife of a nephew of Washington, Mrs.
Tod and James Madison were married. The guests
came from far and near, and there was much merrymaking
and gaiety at the wedding; even the quiet,
reserved bridegroom became transformed and permitted
the girls to cut off bits of Mechlin lace from
his ruffled shirt as mementoes.</p>

<p>The bride and groom went first to Montpelier,
Virginia, Mr. Madison's home, but soon returned
to Philadelphia, where, at the request of her husband,
Dollie, laying aside her Quaker dress, entered society
and began to entertain largely. Her tact and kindness
of heart won every one, and at a time when
party spirit ran high and political differences caused
bitter feeling, Mrs. Madison entertained with dignity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>and elegance, slighting no one, hurting the feelings
of none, and sometimes making friends out of foes.</p>

<p>When Washington died, Mr. and Mrs. Madison
were among his sincere mourners, and helped to
comfort the lonely widow for the loss of her greathearted
husband. When Thomas Jefferson became
President of the United States, James Madison was
made Secretary of State. Mr. Jefferson, being a
widower, and requiring a lady to assist at his state
banquets, often called upon Mrs. Madison to sit at the
head of his table in the White House. Her charms
especially fitted her for such a position.</p>

<p>After Jefferson had served two terms as President,
James Madison was elected to fill his place. At the
inauguration ball Mrs. Madison wore a gown of
buff-colored velvet, a turban with a bird of paradise
plume on her head, and pearls on her beautiful neck
and arms.</p>

<p>During the first years of Madison's administration,
while national affairs were going on smoothly, Mrs.
Madison's entertainments at the White House were
many and popular. She had the rare gift never to
forget a name and the faculty of putting people at
their ease, and thus banishing shyness and stiffness.
Her receptions were never dull. Her sparkling con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>versation
drew the best minds to her, and the ease
with which she met strangers was remarkable.</p>

<p>She was kind alike to rich and poor, and gave generously
of her wealth to the deserving. To her husband
she was an able adviser, her sound common sense and
good judgment often helping him in his decisions of
public matters. President Madison said that, when
he was tired and worn out from matters of state, a visit
to his wife's sitting-room never failed to rest him.</p>

<p>But national affairs were not to remain quiet.
Trouble had long been brewing with England. The
commerce of the United States had been almost entirely
destroyed by acts of the British. The Atlantic
coast from north to south was blockaded by them
and many American seamen were impressed. Washington
and Adams had managed to avert this war,
but now matters were come to a crisis: the whole
nation was inflamed, and on June 18, 1812, Congress
formally declared war.</p>

<p>As most of the fighting was done at sea, life at the
capital went on undisturbed until August 19th, when
it began to be rumored that the British were coming
to attack Washington. The rumor became a certainty
when a horseman dashed through the villages forty
miles below Washington, shouting:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>"To arms! Cockburn is coming!"</p>

<p>The English had landed five thousand men and
were marching toward the capital. Washington
was in a state of panic. Citizens banded together
for defence and marched to meet the enemy. On
August 22, President Madison bade farewell to his
wife and left for the front. Up to this time Mrs.
Madison had been without fear, but now, learning
that the American ships had been destroyed and
knowing that her husband was in danger, she became
very uneasy.</p>

<p>The work of saving records was at once begun.
Important papers were piled into wheelbarrows and
carts and carried away. At three o'clock, August 24,
Mrs. Madison sat anxiously waiting for some word
from her husband. She refused to leave the White
House until a large portrait of General Washington
was saved, and time being too short to admit of its
being unscrewed from the wall, she gave the order
to have the frame broken with an axe and the canvas
taken out. It was sent in a carriage to a woman
living beyond Georgetown, who afterward returned
it to Mrs. Madison. It now hangs in the White
House again.</p>

<p>A hurried note from the President bade her be in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>readiness to leave in a carriage at a moment's notice,
for it was feared the British would destroy the city.
Soon her worst fears were realized, for sounds of approaching
troops were heard. Two gentlemen rushed
into the room, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Fly, madam! At once! The British are upon
us!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Madison suddenly remembered that the
Declaration of Independence, which was kept in a
case separate from other documents, had been overlooked
when the other papers were sent away. She
turned, and notwithstanding the protests of her
friends, ran into the house, broke the glass in the case,
secured the Declaration, and then jumped into the
carriage, which took her to the home of a friend in
Georgetown.</p>

<p>Washington could be rebuilt and many valuable
articles which were destroyed could be replaced, but
the Declaration of Independence once gone would
have been lost forever.</p>

<p>That night, few people in or near the city of Washington
slept. Instead, they watched the flames
destroying the beautiful city, for the British had set
fire to the public buildings, the President's house, the
new Capitol, the Library of Congress, the Treasury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Buildings, the Arsenal and Barracks, besides many
private buildings, and the wind from an approaching
storm fanned the flames, thus completing the fearful
destruction.</p>

<p>Before daybreak, Mrs. Madison left her retreat
and traveled to a small tavern, sixteen miles from
Washington, where her husband met her. Shortly,
word was brought to them that the hiding place of
the President had been discovered, and that the
British were even then in pursuit of him. Mrs.
Madison induced him to retreat at once to a small
house in the woods, while she started for Washington,
first disguising herself, for the English had said that
they were going to capture the beautiful woman and
take her to England.</p>

<p>President Madison, however, learning that the
British had evacuated Washington, returned to the
city that night. His wife had also reached there in
safety. The burning of Washington filled the hearts
of Americans with indignation, and even in England
many condemned the act of Admiral Cockburn,
saying that it was "a return to barbaric times."</p>

<p>After three years of fierce conflict, the peace treaty
between England and the United States was signed
at Ghent, on December 24, 1814. Every one was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>glad, but no one more so than President Madison,
who had been drawn by his party into the war and
who was greatly criticized and blamed for it. The
President and his wife now took a large house on
Pennsylvania Avenue. The brilliancy of social life
at the White House had never been equaled before
Dollie Madison's time, and it is doubtful if it has
been since.</p>

<p>In 1817, James Monroe became President and
Mr. Madison retired to Montpelier, Virginia, where
he and his wife entertained with true Virginian hospitality
the many friends and tourists who came to
visit them. Their home was a beautiful one, containing
many artistic treasures. Here they lived
happily until Mr. Madison's death in 1836.</p>

<p>Soon after her husband's death, Mrs. Madison
returned to Washington to live among her old
friends, and after a time her home again became a
social center. Much consideration was shown her
by Congress and by high officials, who respected her
for her worthy and honorable life, and for her heroism
during the burning of Washington.</p>

<p>During her latter years she was saddened by the
dissolute habits of her only son, Payne Tod, whose
debts had been frequently paid by President Madison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>and who now appealed to his mother for money.
To save him from disgrace she even sold her beloved
Montpelier.</p>

<p>Dollie Madison died in Washington, July 12, 1849,
at the age of eighty-two, and was buried in the cemetery
at Montpelier beside her husband.</p>

<p>Lossing says: "Mrs. Madison adorned every
station in life in which she was placed."</p>

<p>In Warwick, England, lived a family of Quakers
named Gurney. They were not "plain Quakers"
at that time, which means that they did not wear
plain clothes and refrain from the use of ornaments,
nor did they refuse to take part in the pleasures of
the world, as strict Quakers are supposed to do. The
children, nevertheless, were brought up in accordance
with the doctrines of the Bible, very rigidly interpreted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gurney, a woman of fine education and sound
judgment, instructed her little daughters in English,
mathematics, literature, Latin and French, and in domestic
duties. They were taught to sew and to make
plain garments, to oversee the preparation of the
meals, and if necessary, to do the cooking. Very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>great care was taken with their manners, for Mrs.
Gurney believed that gentleness and polite behavior
were necessary in women.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, the third child, born May 21, 1780,
who became the famous Elizabeth Fry, was frail in
health, and so nervous that she was afraid of the
dark. To cure her of this, her father compelled her
to go to bed without a light&mdash;a treatment that only
increased her nervousness and fear. So firmly was
the memory of this severe punishment fixed in the
child's mind that, when she married and had children
of her own, she never permitted any method of discipline
that tended to cause fear.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had not a tractable disposition, but was
inclined to be wilful, obstinate, and opinionated.
Even as a child, she would act independently. This
pronounced trait in her character, so objectionable
in youth, enabled her in later years to do many things
worth while, in the face of unreasonable opposition.</p>

<p>Her mother died when Elizabeth was twelve years
old. As she grew older, she gradually broke loose
from her Quaker training and began to think more
about dress and adornments; she even learned to
dance, and enjoyed going into society. But, while
enjoying these pleasures, she all the while realized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>that she was not really happy. Then she tried to
find out the reason. She went among the poor and
helped them, but this was no more than all Quakers
did. She feared that she was becoming more and
more satisfied with the light, pleasant, easy things
of life, while the great and good things that might
be done ever haunted her, and called to her to regard
them.</p>

<p>At this time a traveling Quaker preacher named
William Savery, a man of great force and a powerful
and compelling speaker, came over from America.
He addressed a meeting of Friends which the Gurney
sisters attended, including Elizabeth, all sitting in
a row on the women's side in the Meeting-House.
These young girls wore some ornaments and were
more elaborately dressed than the other Quaker girls.
When the speaker touched on this matter of adornment
and in a gentle, tender voice pleaded for the
customs of the plain Quakers, Elizabeth was much
affected; all her pleasures seemed to her sinful, and
she wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Afterward she had long talks with William Savery,
in the course of which, it is said, he prophesied her
future. His words changed Elizabeth utterly; she
cared no more for the world and its pleasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>Her father, to test the genuineness of her conversion,
induced her to visit friends in London who lived
in the midst of gaiety. There, she attended the
theater, but was not interested; she danced, but
found it dreary; she played cards, but was wearied.
All the enjoyments of former times failed to satisfy
her. She returned home, and after several months
spent in meditation, finally came to the conclusion
that, for her at least, those things were wrong; that,
for her, life held more important duties. She then
gave up all amusements, began to use the "thee"
and "thou" of the strict sect, adopted the close cap
and plain kerchief of the Quakeress, and preached
at meetings.</p>

<p>Once her mind had cleared, she never wavered in
the belief that her life must be devoted to works of
charity. She began by opening a school for poor
children. She was only nineteen, very youthful-looking
and very pretty. Everybody wondered how
she could govern this school of seventy wild street-children,
who had never before known restraint.</p>

<p>While she was occupied with this school, a young
Quaker from London, named Joseph Fry, fell in
love with her and proposed marriage. At first
Elizabeth thought she could not accept Joseph's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>offer; that to marry would interfere with her plans.
But the young man was deeply interested in benevolent
work, himself, and had sufficient means to assist
her in her projects.</p>

<p>So they were married at Norwich, and later their
home at St. Mildred's Court, London, became a
meeting place for Quakers from all parts of the world.
Instead of card-games and dancing for their entertainment,
the visitors in this house heard discussions
of plans for the formation of poorhouses, schools, and
hospitals for the poor.</p>

<p>In 1809, Elizabeth's father died; and on her knees
by his bedside, Elizabeth again vowed to devote
her life to the service of God. She now lived in
Plashet, Essex, the country seat of her husband's
family. With growing children of her own about
her and great numbers of guests, one might suppose
that she had all she could possibly do. Nevertheless,
she found time to open a girls' school for street-children,
to organize a soup kitchen, a drug-store,
and a library for them, while in her own home she
kept a collection of clothes of all sorts with which to
clothe them.</p>

<p>When this enterprise was well established and the
poor people about her made comfortable, Mrs. Fry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>turned her attention to the great prison at Newgate,
London, where conditions were reported to be shocking.
In company with officials and a party of friends,
she made her first visit, in 1813. They found
things much worse than they had been led to believe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry at once determined to reform prison
life. Illness in the family delayed this project for
nearly three years; but the idea never left her until
at last the work was begun. The life of the prisoners
in Newgate, and in all prisons at that time, was too
harrowing to be here described.</p>

<p>The public listened to her reports, were properly
shocked, but scoffed at the bare idea of Elizabeth
Fry as a reformer. For a <em>woman</em> to attempt such
a work was absurd! Mrs. Fry paid no attention to
what was said, but went straight ahead. She began
by establishing a school for the prisoners' children,
and gave the wretched women prisoners work for
which they were paid. Before this, being idle, they
had spent their time quarreling, fighting and gambling;
now, when they could earn a little money,
their behavior began to improve.</p>

<p>Soon Parliament took an interest in this work,
ordering an investigation. When the wonderful reforms
she had accomplished became known, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Fry was the most famous woman in England.
Queen Victoria expressed a desire to become acquainted
with her, and a meeting was arranged which
has been described as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Her Majesty's small figure, her dress ablaze with diamonds,
her courtesy and kindness as she spoke to the
now celebrated Quakeress, who stood outwardly calm
in the costume of her creed and just a little flushed with
the unwonted excitement, attracted universal homage.
The two women spoke, and cheer after cheer went up
from the crowd gathered about.</p></div>

<p>The Court learned that day that there was in
goodness and benevolence something better than
fashion and nobler than rank.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry's work for the poor and unfortunate
took her to the prisons of many lands, and everywhere
honors were bestowed upon her. She died at
the age of sixty, October 13, 1845.</p>

<h2>LUCRETIA MOTT</h2>

<p class="center">(1793-1880)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is in every true woman's heart a spark of heavenly
fire which beams and blazes in the dark hours of adversity."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Washington Irving</em></p>
</div>


<p>Born on the quaint little island of Nantucket,
January 3, 1793, Lucretia Coffin grew to girlhood
among peaceful and beautiful surroundings. Her
father was Captain of a whaler and was, consequently,
often away from home for long periods of
time, so that the mother was responsible for the
early training of the children.</p>

<p>Lucretia and her sisters were taught to be thrifty
in household matters, and trustworthy in all the
relations of life. Industry, too, was greatly encouraged
in the Coffin family. When the mother had
to go out, she would set her daughters at their knitting,
telling them that when they had accomplished
a certain amount of work, they might go down into
the cellar and pick out as many of the small potatoes
as they wanted, and roast them. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>considered a great treat, and we can picture the six
little children gathered about the big fireplace watching
the potatoes in the ashes.</p>

<p>Captain Coffin gave up the sea at last and moved
his family to Boston, where he entered into business.
The children at first attended a private school, but
Captain Coffin, who was nothing if not democratic,
decided afterward that they should go to the public
school, where they might "mingle with all classes
without distinction." Lucretia said in after life
that she was glad of this action of her father. "It
gave me a feeling of sympathy for the patient and
struggling poor, whom but for this experience, I
might never have known."</p>

<p>At thirteen years of age, Lucretia was sent to a
Friends' boarding school at Nine Partners, New York.
Both boys and girls attended this school, but were
not permitted to speak to each other unless they
were near relatives. In that case they might talk
together a little while, on certain days, over a corner
of the fence that divided the playgrounds.</p>

<p>One of Lucretia's sisters&mdash;"the desirable little
Elizabeth," as her father called her&mdash;accompanied
her to this school. These sisters, although very
different in character, loved each other with a pecul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>iarly
deep affection. Elizabeth, though clever, was
retiring in disposition and always kept in the background,
while Lucretia, who was high-spirited and
wide awake, was inclined to take the lead among her
companions. Throughout their lives they remained
devoted friends, and although Elizabeth could never
be persuaded to take any part in public life, she
counseled and advised her distinguished sister, who
seldom took any important action without consulting
her.</p>

<p>At this school, on the boys' side of the house, was
an able young teacher named James Mott. It
happened one day that a little boy, a cousin of James
Mott, was punished by being confined in a dark closet,
being allowed only bread and water for his supper.
Lucretia, who thought the boy had not been at fault,
managed to get some bread and butter to him. This
act attracted the attention of James Mott to the girl,
and afterward his sister Sarah, who also attended
the school, became Lucretia's most intimate friend.
During one of the vacations, Lucretia visited Sarah
Mott and thus met the family into which she afterward
married.</p>

<p>When fifteen years old, Lucretia became assistant
teacher in this school, at a salary of one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>dollars a year. Her father, who thought women should
be trained to usefulness, gave his consent to have
Lucretia remain away from home for this extra
year, which proved to be an eventful one for her.
The two young teachers, James Mott and Lucretia
Coffin, found that they had many ideas in common.
Both had ability and both were desirous of gaining
knowledge. They formed a French class and it was
while studying together that their attachment began.</p>

<p>It was at this time, also, that Lucretia became
impressed with the unequal condition of women as
compared with that of men. She said:</p>

<p>"Learning that the charge for the tuition of girls
was the same as that for boys, and that when they became
teachers, women received only half as much as
men for their services, the injustice of this distinction
was so apparent that I early resolved to claim
for myself all that an impartial Creator had bestowed."
She little thought at the time what an
important part she would play in supporting that
claim.</p>

<p>While the two sisters were at school, their father
gave up his business in Boston and took charge of a
factory in Philadelphia, where Lucretia and Elizabeth
joined him in 1810. Soon after, James Mott
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>resigned his position as teacher and followed them to
Philadelphia, entering business life. In a short time,
he and Lucretia became engaged. These two young
people were just different enough to live in harmony
together.</p>

<p>Lucretia was a bright, active and very pretty girl,
quick to understand and quick to execute,&mdash;qualities
that often made her impatient with the slowness
or stupidity of others. She was fond of a joke, too.</p>

<p>James, on the other hand, was quiet, reserved and
shy, taking serious views of life. In 1811, they were
married according to Quaker rites. Then began one
of the happiest of wedded lives,&mdash;and in spite of
privations, for James Mott always found it difficult to
support his family.</p>

<p>When Lucretia's father died, leaving her mother
with three children to support, the Motts did all they
could to help her. Lucretia opened a school for the
purpose, and soon afterward her husband's business
ventures prospered, so that he, too, could assist.</p>

<p>Just as their prospects were brightening, however,
there came a severe blow in the death of their only
son. Lucretia then gave up teaching and spent a
great deal of time in the study of the Bible and of
theology. She used to read William Penn, Dean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Stanley, and John Stuart Mill with her baby on her
knee.</p>

<p>Soon she took her place as a preacher in the Society
of Friends, feeling "called," as she tells us, "to a
public life of usefulness"; and during the latter part
of the year 1818, she accompanied another minister
named Sarah Zane to Virginia, for the purpose of
holding religious meetings. Here Mrs. Mott came
into contact with the question of slavery, and in all
her discourses she never failed to urge the doctrine of
emancipation. She believed in liberty of the body
and liberty of thought; indeed, her belief in liberty
may be said to have been the basis of all her sermons.</p>

<p>The Quakers who held slaves freed them as early
as 1774. The Society of Friends, to which Mr. and
Mrs. Mott belonged, became so interested in the
slavery question as to recommend that any goods
produced by slave-labor should not be handled by
any Quaker in regular standing. Mr. Mott was at
that time engaged in a prosperous cotton business,
but consistent with his views, he gave up this
business,&mdash;for a while finding great difficulty in
making a living.</p>

<p>In 1833, the Female Anti-Slavery Society was
formed in Philadelphia. Mrs. Mott was one of four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>women who, braving public opinion, gave their voices
to the cause of Freedom. She was President of the
society during most of its existence; and it was due
mainly to her inspiring presence, her courage and
activity, and her unfailing dignity, that the society
accomplished its great work.</p>

<p>She sheltered fugitive slaves, everywhere befriended
the colored people, and traveled from place to place
preaching the doctrine of liberty.</p>

<p>Young people of the present time can hardly understand
the bitter and fierce opposition encountered by
those people who were working to free the slaves.
For many years, public feeling on the subject was so
intense that many anti-slavery meetings were broken
up by acts of violence. Sometimes mobs of men and
women stoned the windows of the houses where these
meetings were being held, breaking into the assemblage,
leaping upon the platform, and shouting so
loudly that the speaker's voice was lost in the noise.</p>

<p>In 1838, during a riot in Philadelphia, a mob
burned Pennsylvania Hall, and then marched through
the streets threatening an attack upon the house of
James and Lucretia Mott. Mrs. Mott sent her children
out of the house to a place of safety, and she,
with her husband and a few friends, sat quietly wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>ing
for the mob. Before it reached the house, however,
the leaders urged the rioters to attack a home
for colored orphans in another part of the city, and
so the raid upon the Mott house was given up for
that night.</p>

<p>At another time, when the mob was expected, and
when Mr. and Mrs. Mott, surrounded by their friends,
sat listening to the angry cries of threatening men outside,
it happened that in the crowd was a young man
friendly to the Mott family. He cried, "On to the
Motts'!" and purposely ran up the wrong street. The
rioters followed him blindly, and the Motts were a
second time saved from violence.</p>

<p>Women who had formerly been Mrs. Mott's
friends passed her on the street without speaking,
and scornful people laughed at her. Sometimes
rough men, carried away by the excitement of the
times, surged round her like maniacs, threatening
violence, but Mrs. Mott never lost her temper or her
composed manner. In her own story of her life she
says, "The misrepresentation, ridicule and abuse
heaped upon these reforms do not in the least deter
me from my duty."</p>

<p>When the National Anti-Slavery Society was
formed, Mrs. Mott took a prominent part, offering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>suggestions with "such charm and precision that
they were readily assented to." In this work she was
associated with Garrison, Whittier, and other noted
Abolitionists.</p>

<p>In 1840, Mrs. Mott was sent to London to represent
the Abolitionists of the United States at the
World's Anti-Slavery Convention, where she met
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, also a delegate. They were
not permitted to take their places in the Convention,
for by a vote taken at their first sitting, that body
decided that only men were to be admitted. Aside
from this, however, the women were treated with the
greatest courtesy. But, though their feelings were
supposed to be salved by being given seats of honor
in the hall, they felt keenly the humiliation of their
position. It was certainly an indignity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mott had for years been accustomed to
speaking in public, people of all denominations coming
many miles to hear the great Quaker preacher.
Her home had been a refuge for hunted slaves, and
all her eloquence was devoted to the cause of their
freedom. Without doubt, she was one of the most
prominent persons present at this meeting. She, if
anyone, should have been allowed to speak in behalf
of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Out of the indignation aroused on this occasion in
the minds of Mrs. Mott and Mrs. Stanton, grew the
Woman Suffrage Movement. The first Woman's
Rights Convention was called in Seneca Falls, New
York, July, 1848, the rights of women to the ballot
and their equality with man under the law being
the subjects discussed.</p>

<p>James Mott approved of his wife's course and
assisted her all that he could by presiding at the first
meeting. No end of ridicule was heaped upon the
women who thus openly claimed equal rights with
men, but Mrs. Mott argued her cause so politely and
so wittily that her opponents were disarmed. It is a
pleasure to know that Lucretia Mott lived to see the
slaves freed and to note the change of public opinion
toward herself and others who had worked for
freedom.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Mott was seventy-five and her husband
eighty years of age, they went to Brooklyn to visit
their grandchildren. While there, Mr. Mott was
taken ill with pneumonia and passed away quietly
while his wife was sleeping on the pillow beside him.
Colored men bore him to his grave, at their own request,
to show their regard for one who had worked
so persistently to benefit their race. The Motts'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>married life had been one of great happiness, not the
slightest shadow having ever come between them.
One who knew them well said, "Theirs was the most
perfect wedded life to be found on earth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mott was greatly solaced to know that her
opponents had changed their opinions in respect to
her. During the latter part of her life, it was no
unusual thing for a stranger to stop her in the street
and ask the privilege of shaking hands. Once a
woman in mourning passed quickly by her, whispering,
"God bless you, Lucretia Mott."</p>

<p>Each Christmas Day she visited the Colored Home
in Philadelphia, carrying turkeys and pies and personal
gifts to every inmate. She also sent a box
of candy to every conductor and brakeman on the
railroad on which she traveled, saying: "They never
let me lift out my bundles, and they all seem to
know me!" The number of children, both black
and white, named after her, was astonishing.</p>

<p>At the Centennial Anniversary of the Old Pennsylvania
Abolition Society, Lucretia Mott was
greeted by the vast audience with cheers and waving
of handkerchiefs and hats. Another ovation occurred
at a July Fourth meeting of the National Woman
Suffrage Association. When she rose to speak some-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>one
called to her, "Go up into the pulpit!" As she
ascended the pulpit steps, all sang, "Nearer, my God,
to Thee!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mott lived twelve years after her husband's
death; then she too passed away, on November 11,
1880, at the age of eighty-seven.</p>

<p>All women have cause to remember her with
affection, for she braved public opinion to secure
recognition for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<h2>MARY LYON</h2>

<p class="center">(1797-1849)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Human kind is but one family. The education of its
youth should be equal and universal."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Frances Wright D'Arusmont</em></p>
</div>


<p>To-day if a girl wishes to obtain an education equal
to that of a man, the doors of many colleges and other
institutions of learning are open to her. It is not so
many years ago that this was not the case. Most
people, then, thought that girls had no need for a
knowledge of the higher branches, and it is largely
owing to Mary Lyon that the young women of to-day
have such splendid advantages for education.</p>

<p>Born in Buckland, in Western Massachusetts,
February 28, 1797, Mary began life, poor and obscure.
She was the fifth of a family of seven children,
and her early life was one of hard work and of
meager opportunity.</p>

<p>Yet it was not unhappy. Her mountain home was
well kept, and her parents governed entirely by
kindness, insisting upon gentle words, pleasant looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>and thoughtfulness for others, on the part of all the
children. Out of doors all was beautiful. The
mountains, the rocks and streams, the fine trees
which surrounded the house,&mdash;all gave the child
much pleasure. To Mary it seemed as though the
peaches and the strawberries raised on their own
little farm were larger and more delicious than any
others. Her parents had a wonderful faculty for
making things grow, and the neighbors said that
the plants in Mrs. Lyon's dooryard always bloomed
more luxuriantly than any others in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>When Mary was four years old her father died, but
her mother, with the help of a hired man, continued
the work of the farm and succeeded in supporting
her family. Mary, as she grew up, did much of the
housework and the spinning. In those days, nearly
every family spun the thread to weave the cloth for
their own garments, and by the time she was twelve
years old, Mary had become expert at this work.</p>

<p>At the age of seven, Mary walked two miles to
school. She delighted in her studies and made such
rapid progress that visitors to the school were astonished.
Finally, the district school moved still farther
away, and then Mary went to Ashfield to study,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>living there during school months and doing housework
to pay for her board.</p>

<p>Every spare moment was spent over her books
and, when she was twelve years old, Mary Lyon
determined to become a teacher. None of the other
girls in the school had any definite purpose as to the
future. The boys planned to become carpenters,
farmers, teachers, lawyers, or ministers, but girls
were supposed to become wives, mothers and housekeepers,
for which offices no special training was
thought necessary. Since that time, fortunately
for the race, public opinion has changed in this respect;
to-day, everybody knows that in order to
manage a household well, to rear children, and to
make a happy home, girls need to have a great deal
of knowledge.</p>

<p>When Mary Lyon announced her intention of being
a teacher, the community was astonished, not to say
shocked. It was predicted that she would fail.
Men, not women, were meant for the teaching profession!
Mary's proficiency in her studies, however,
could not be denied. Early and late she pored over
her books; in four days, to the amazement of her
teacher, she learned all of Alexander's Grammar and
recited it perfectly. When she was thirteen, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>mother married again and went to live in Ohio, but
Mary remained on the farm and kept house for her
only brother. He paid her one dollar a week&mdash;a
large sum for a girl to earn in the year 1810.</p>

<p>For a while it looked as though her high ambitions
would never be realized, but the brave girl did not
know the word despair. She studied all she could
and read every book she could lay her hands upon.
After five years spent in this way her brother married
and went away, leaving his sister free to do as she
pleased.</p>

<p>Thus thrown entirely upon her own resources,
Mary began her career as a teacher in Shelburne
Falls. Seventy-five cents a week and board made
up her munificent salary. By dint of spinning and
weaving for some of the neighbors, she earned a
little more. Luckily, she did not care for fine clothes
or trinkets, so that at the age of twenty she had
saved enough money to enable her to spend a term
at Sanderson Academy at Ashfield. This was her
great opportunity and she improved it well, making
a real sensation in the school by her brilliancy. They
say that when Mary Lyon stood up to recite, her
class-mates laid aside their tasks to listen to her.</p>

<p>The term over, Mary planned to go back to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>ing,
for she had no money to continue her studies.
It so happened that some of the trustees of the Academy,
hearing of her unusual scholarship, offered her
another term, tuition free. Mary thankfully accepted
this favor, and doubtless, had wonderful dreams
of the use she might make of all her knowledge when
she should get it. But, first, she must plan some
way to pay her board while studying. Among her
possessions were some bedding, some table linen, and
a few other household articles. These she succeeded
in exchanging at a boarding house for a room and
a seat at table. Her companions in the boarding
house told of her that she slept but four hours,
spending all the remainder of her time at her books.</p>

<p>But though she had now reached a point in
scholarship where she could easily hold a position
as teacher, Mary Lyon by no means considered her
education completed. All her vacations were spent
in the study of some branch in which she found herself
deficient. She spent some time in the family of
the Reverend Edward Hitchcock, afterward President
of Amherst College, with whom she studied
natural science, at the same time taking lessons in
drawing and painting from his wife.</p>

<p>In 1821, at the age of twenty-four, Mary had saved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>enough money to enable her to enter the school of
Reverend Joseph Emerson at Byfield. Her friends
were strongly opposed to her going, telling her that
she knew enough already; that, as she would never
be a minister, it was unnecessary for her to study
more. But Mary had other ideas, and could not be
diverted from her purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Emerson was a broad-minded man of very
advanced notions for his day and generation. He
actually believed that women could understand philosophical
subjects as well as men and that, if their
minds demanded good solid food, they ought to have
it! His wife was a woman of much ability, and together
they discussed questions of science and religion
with their pupils.</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly these discussions that turned
Mary Lyon's mind and thoughts to spiritual things.
Heretofore, she had been so absorbed in her passion
for general knowledge that the matter of religion had
never touched her. Suddenly the fact burst upon
her that all things in this life were useless and
unsatisfying, except as they were used in helping
humanity. From this time on, her work of teaching
seemed little short of inspired.</p>

<p>When, later, an assistant was wanted at Sanderson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>Academy, notwithstanding the opposition of many
who believed that a man should fill the place, Mary
Lyon was selected for the position. Before long one
of her former teachers, Miss F. P. Grant, sent for her
to fill a higher position at Derry, New Hampshire.
Mary delayed going in order to take some lessons in
chemistry from Professor Eaton of Amherst.</p>

<p>The school in Derry numbered ninety pupils. It
was held only during the summer months, and during
the winter Mary again taught at Ashfield and Bucklands.
She charged twenty-five cents a week for
tuition, the scholars boarding with families in the
vicinity, at the rate of $1.25 weekly. Meanwhile
Miss Grant, who had removed to Ipswich, induced
Miss Lyon to join her there. Together they conducted
the Ipswich Academy, and together they
worked out their ideas of what a school should be.</p>

<p>During these years of teaching, Mary Lyon's heart
had been full of sympathy for girls who desired an
education but could not obtain it. There were no
scholarships offered in those days and the doors of
men's colleges were closed to women. At Ipswich,
Mary found it impossible to conduct a good school
on the income derived from the fees of the pupils.
So she tried to interest wealthy men, ministers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>college presidents in her plan of forming a high-grade
school or college for women, asking those who were
able, to donate a sum of money for the purpose.</p>

<p>Most of these men refused to aid her in the project,
repeating the old story that "girls had no need for a
knowledge of science or the classics; that, in fact,
they were unfitted for studying advanced branches."
Miss Lyon held a quite different view, and stuck to
her purpose through every discouragement.</p>

<p>Yet, sometimes even brave Mary Lyon had moments
of despondency, when she would weep bitterly
over her failure to interest others in her plans. But
the idea of giving up the work never crossed her mind.
She often said to her pupils, "If you feel depressed,
think of others, not of yourself!"</p>

<p>About this time she refused a good offer of marriage,
saying that her life was devoted to one purpose
and that she must give herself entirely to her work.
She prayed, and begged her mother to pray, for success.
Over and over again she would say: "Commit
thy way unto the Lord. He will keep thee.
Women <em>must</em> be educated. They <em>must</em> be!"</p>

<p>At last her faith turned to a faint hope. People
began to be interested, and she now gave all her time
to the work of soliciting funds. It was her desire to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>raise the first thousand dollars from women, and this
she succeeded in doing in two months' time. Dr.
Hitchcock, always her staunch friend, aided her with
his support and approval, and one by one broad-minded,
noble men lent their assistance, until the
Female Seminary was an assured thing.</p>

<p>On October 3, 1836, the corner stone of Mount
Holyoke Seminary was laid at South Hadley, Massachusetts.
Mary Lyon in writing to a friend of the
occasion said: "I have indeed lived to see the time
when a body of gentlemen has ventured to lay the
corner stone of an edifice, which will cost $15,000
and which will be an institution for the education of
females. This will be an era in female education."</p>

<p>In about one year the Seminary was opened to
pupils. Since its advantages were intended chiefly
to benefit poor girls, the charges were placed at the
low figure of sixty dollars a year for board and tuition.
There were accommodations for eighty pupils, but
one hundred and sixteen attended the first year!</p>

<p>In order to lessen expenses, as well as to insure
good health and to teach domestic science, all the
household work was done by the pupils. Moreover,
if it could be shown that the graduates of the Seminary
had acquired a knowledge of household matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>together with their classical and scientific studies,
the prejudice which existed against education for
girls might be lessened.</p>

<p>Miss Lyon received a salary of two hundred dollars
a year, and her teachers received from one hundred
to one hundred and fifty dollars each. Catherine
Beecher once took Mary Lyon to task for the small
salaries paid her teachers. Miss Lyon replied, "In
a list of motives for teaching, I should first place the
great motive, 'Love thy neighbor as thyself'." She
aimed to employ only such teachers as would work
as she did&mdash;for the benefit of humanity. Her own
best reward was the love which her pupils manifested
for her, and the respect with which they treated her.</p>

<p>She never had any trouble with discipline because
she never required anything of the students but compliance
with the ordinary rules of lady-like behavior,
consideration for others, and attention to their studies.
They were expected to do right, or to go away.
The fact is that none but earnest workers sought to
enter Mount Holyoke.</p>

<p>After twelve years as Principal of Mount Holyoke
Seminary, Miss Lyon died, March 5, 1849, and was
buried in the Seminary grounds. Over her grave
is a beautiful monument of white Italian marble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>bearing the memorable sentence she uttered when
giving her last instruction to her scholars:</p>

<p>"There is nothing in the world I fear, but that I
shall not know all my duty or shall fail to do it!"</p>

<p>To her was due one of the greatest revolutions in
the history of our country. She reversed the prevailing
opinion of the men of that time regarding
female education, and was the grand pioneer in a
movement which has gone steadily forward ever
since.</p>

<p>To-day the property of Mount Holyoke is worth
$3,000,000. Thousands of girls have been educated
there, many of whom have become missionaries and
teachers. Many others have married, their education
enabling them to be better wives and mothers,
and to do their full duty in any station in life to
which they may be called.</p>

<h2>DOROTHEA DIX</h2>

<p class="center">(1802-1887)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Great women belong to history and to self-sacrifice."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Leigh Hunt</em></p>
</div>


<p>Dorothea Dix has been called "the most useful
and distinguished woman America has yet produced."
Let us follow the events of her life and decide for
ourselves whether this statement is true.</p>

<p>Dorothea Lynde Dix was born April 4, 1802, at
Hampden, Maine. Her father, Joseph Dix, was a
man of unstable character and of a most singular
mental make-up. In fact, he was regarded as almost
insane on religious questions. He wandered about
from place to place writing and publishing tracts,
spending in this way the little money he had, without
regard to the needs of his family. His wife and
children were required to assist in the stitching and
pasting of the tracts, a tiresome work which brought
them no return.</p>

<p>At twelve years of age Dorothea rebelled against
this labor. She wished to attend school, but there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>was little chance for her to study while she lived with
her father. So she ran away from Worcester, where
the family then lived, and went to Boston, the home
of her grandmother, Mrs. Dorothea Lynde Dix.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dix received the girl as kindly as her nature
would permit. But she was a stern woman, with
very strict ideas of training children, and every piece
of work done for her had to be perfectly performed
or severe punishment followed.</p>

<p>Once, when little Dorothea had failed to accomplish
a task as well as her grandmother thought she
should, she was compelled to spend a whole week alone
without speaking to anyone. This sounds cruel, but
Dorothea's grandmother wished to make the child
careful and painstaking.</p>

<p>Poor little Dorothea! She said in after years that
she "never knew childhood." But she submitted
to her grandmother's sternness rather than return to
her father and the wandering, useless life he led.
She had always in mind the day when she would be
able to support herself and help her younger brothers.
So she studied diligently, and being clever, made
great progress. When she was fourteen, she returned
to Worcester, where she opened a small school
for young children. In order to look old enough for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>a teacher, she lengthened the skirts of her dresses and
arranged her hair grown-woman fashion.</p>

<p>The school succeeded, for Dorothea, though always
kind and gentle, was a strict disciplinarian. The
year following, she returned to Boston and studied to
fit herself for more advanced work in teaching. In
1821, when she was nineteen years of age, she opened
a day and boarding school in that city, in a house
belonging to her grandmother. Here she received
pupils from the best families in Boston and the
neighboring towns, and was able to send for her
brothers and educate them, while supporting herself.
Dorothea's sympathies, meanwhile, were drawn to
the poor children about her, who had no means of
obtaining an education because their parents could
not afford to pay the tuition. She put the matter
before her austere grandmother, and begged for the
use of a loft over the stable for a school room for these
children. The little "barn school" was the beginning
of a movement that grew, and later resulted
in the Warren Street Chapel.</p>

<p>You may imagine how happy Dorothea Dix was
now,&mdash;to be self-supporting and to be helping others
to become so! She managed the two schools, had
the care of her two brothers, and took entire charge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>of her grandmother's home. For Mrs. Dix had
learned to admire and trust the granddaughter whom
she had once found so careless.</p>

<p>This amount of work would completely fill the
lives of most people, yet Dorothea found time to
prepare a text-book upon <cite>Common Things</cite>. Sixty
editions of the book were printed and sold. It was
followed by two others: <cite>Hymns for Children</cite> and
<cite>Evening Hours</cite>.</p>

<p>In order to do all this work, she arose early and sat
up late into the night. Naturally her health failed
under such a strain. After six years she gave up
her schools, and took a position as governess in a
family living at Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Here
she lived much in the open air, and her great desire
for universal knowledge led her to make a special
study of botany and marine life.</p>

<p>Her health failing again, she visited Philadelphia,
and then went South as far as Alexandria, Virginia,
writing short stories the while to support herself.
The winter of 1830 she spent in the West Indies with
the family of Dr. Channing. There she at last regained
her health.</p>

<p>The following spring, Miss Dix returned to Boston,
and reopened her school in the old Dix homestead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Pupils flocked to her, and for five years the work
flourished. Her influence over her pupils was wonderful.
They thought her very beautiful, as indeed
she was. Mrs. Livermore writes of her: "Miss
Dix was slight and delicate in appearance. She
must have been beautiful in her youth and was still
very sweet looking, with a soft voice, graceful figure
and winning manners."</p>

<p>In 1836, ill health obliged her to close her school
once more. This time she went to England. Though
only thirty-four, she had saved enough money to
enable her to live in comfort without labor. Shortly
after, her grandmother died, leaving her enough to
carry out the plans for helping others, which had
become a part of her life. She then returned from
England and made her home in Washington.</p>

<p>In 1841, however, we find her again in Boston and
at this time her real life work began. It happened
that a minister well known to Miss Dix had charge
of a Sunday school in the East Cambridge jail. He
needed a teacher to take charge of a class of twenty
women, and asked Miss Dix if she could tell him of
any suitable person.</p>

<p>Miss Dix thought the matter over and then said,
"I will take the class myself!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>Her friends objected because of her frail health,
but having once arrived at a decision, Dorothea Dix
never changed her mind. As one of her pupils said,
"Fixed as fate, we considered her!"</p>

<p>The following Sunday, after the session was over,
she went into the jail and talked with many of the
prisoners. It seemed that they had many righteous
grievances, one being that no heat of any kind was
provided for their cells.</p>

<p>When Miss Dix asked the keeper of the jail to heat
the rooms, he replied that the prisoners did not
need heat, and that besides, stoves would be unsafe.
Though she begged him to do something to make the
cells more comfortable, he refused. She then brought
the case before the Court in East Cambridge. The
Court granted her request and heat was furnished
the prisoners.</p>

<p>In the East Cambridge jail she saw many things
too horrible to believe. The cells were dirty, the
inmates crowded together in poorly ventilated quarters,
the sane and insane often being placed in the
same room. These conditions, and others too sad to
mention, she made public through the newspapers and
the pulpits. But she did not stop at this. Every jail
and almshouse in Massachusetts was visited by her;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>she must see for herself how the unfortunate inmates
were treated. For two years she traveled about, visiting
these institutions and taking notes. Then she
prepared her famous Memorial to the Legislature.</p>

<p>In this Memorial Miss Dix said: "I proceed,
gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present
state of insane persons within this Commonwealth,
in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens, chained and
naked, beaten with rods and lashed into obedience."
Proofs were offered for all facts stated.</p>

<p>The Memorial was presented by Dr. S. G. Howe,
husband of Julia Ward Howe. Dr. Howe was then
a member of the Legislature. The conditions thus
made public shocked the entire community, so that,
after much discussion, a bill was passed enlarging
the asylum at Worcester. A small beginning, yet
the grand work of reform was started, and Miss Dix
was grateful.</p>

<p>She then turned her attention to other States,
visiting the jails, almshouses, and insane asylums as
far west as Illinois and as far south as Louisiana.
In Rhode Island she found the insane shockingly
treated.</p>

<p>At that time there lived in Providence a very rich
man named Butler. He had never been known to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>give anything to help the unfortunate, but Miss Dix
decided to appeal to him. People smiled when they
heard that she intended to call upon Mr. Butler and
ask him for money.</p>

<p>During the call, he talked of everything except
the subject nearest Miss Dix's heart, "talking against
time," as they say, to prevent her from putting the
vital question. At length she said in a quiet but
forceful manner:</p>

<p>"<em>Mr. Butler, I wish you to hear what I have to say.</em>
I bring before you certain facts involving terrible
suffering to your fellow creatures, suffering you can
relieve."</p>

<p>She then told him what she had seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Butler heard her story to the end without
interruption. Then he said,</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"I want you to give $50,000 to enlarge the insane
hospital in this city!"</p>

<p>"Madam, I'll do it!" was the reply.</p>

<p>After three years of this sort of work, Miss Dix
became an expert on the question of how an insane
asylum should be built and managed. In New Jersey,
she succeeded after much hard work in securing the
passage of a bill establishing the New Jersey State
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Lunatic Asylum, and the money necessary to build
it. This building was a model for the times.</p>

<p>For twelve years she went up and down through
the United States in the interests of the suffering
insane, securing the enlargement of three asylums
and the building of thirteen.</p>

<p>In 1850, Miss Dix secured the passage of a bill giving
twelve million acres of public lands for the benefit of
the poor insane, the deaf and dumb, and the blind.
Applause went up all over the country, yet, strange
to say, after the passage of the bill by both Houses,
President Franklin Pierce vetoed it!</p>

<p>This was a severe blow to Miss Dix and she again
went to Europe for a rest. But rest she could not.
All the large European cities had abuses of this kind
to be corrected, and she must work to help them.</p>

<p>A most interesting story is told of her encounter
with Pope Pius <abbr title="the ninth">IX</abbr>. In vain had she tried to get
authority in Rome to enable her to do something to
improve the horrible Italian prisons. She had even
tried, but vainly, to get audience with the Pope. One
day she saw his carriage, <em>stopped it</em>, and addressed him,
willy-nilly, in <em>Latin</em>, as she knew no Italian. Her enterprise
appears to have impressed the Pope favorably,
for he gave her everything she asked for. In her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>own country, again, she extended her labors to the
Western States. Then the breaking out of the Civil
War rendered such labors useless.</p>

<p>But now there were the soldiers to help! Her
active interest in them came about in the following
way:</p>

<p>Shortly after April, 1861, she happened to be passing
through Baltimore when the Sixth Regiment of
Massachusetts, on its way to Washington, was
stoned by a vast mob, several men being killed.
At once Miss Dix knew what to do. She took the
first train she could get for Washington, and reported
at the War Department for free service in the hospitals,
where through Secretary Simon Cameron, she
immediately received the appointment as "Superintendent
of Women Nurses." Here, truly, was an
enormous piece of work for her.</p>

<p>Among her duties were the selection and assignment
of women nurses; the superintendence of the
thousands of women already serving; the seeing
that supplies were fairly distributed; and looking
after the proper care of wounded soldiers. Her remarkable
executive ability soon brought order and
system out of confusion. It is said that she accepted
no women who were under thirty years of age, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>demanded that they be plain in dress and without
beauty. Good health and good moral character were
also, of course, requirements.</p>

<p>Many of the surgeons and nurses disliked her.
They said she was severe, that she would not listen
to any advice nor take any suggestions. The real
cause of her unpopularity, however, was that she demanded
of all about her entire unselfishness and strict
devotion to work. Very severe was she with careless
nurses or rough surgeons.</p>

<p>Two houses were rented by her to hold the supplies
sent to her care, and still other houses were rented for
convalescent soldiers or nurses who needed rest.
She employed two secretaries, owned ambulances and
kept them busy, printed and distributed circulars, settled
disputes in matters which concerned her nurses,
took long journeys when necessary, and paid from
her own private purse many expenses incurred.
Everything she possessed&mdash;fortune, time, strength&mdash;she
gave to her country in its time of need.</p>

<p>During the four years of the War, Miss Dix never
took a holiday. Often she had to be reminded of her
meals, so interested was she in the work. At the
close of the War, when the Hon. Edwin M. Stanton,
then Secretary of War, asked her how the nation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>could best thank her for her services, she answered,
"I would like a flag."</p>

<p>Two beautiful flags were given to her with a suitable
inscription. These flags she bequeathed to Harvard
College, and they now hang over the doors of
Memorial Hall.</p>

<p>The War over, Miss Dix again took up her work
for the insane and for fifteen years more devoted
herself to their welfare.</p>

<p>In 1881, at the age of seventy-nine, she retired to
the hospital she had been the means of building at
Trenton, New Jersey, and here she was tenderly
cared for until her death in 1887.</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h2>MARGARET FULLER D'OSSOLI</h2>

<p class="center">(1810-1850)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have always said it: Nature meant to make woman its
masterpiece."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing</em></p>
</div>


<p>Margaret Fuller was born in Cambridgeport,
Massachusetts, May 23, 1810. Her parents were
people of great culture and refinement, and devotedly
attached to each other. Margaret wrote years after
her father's death:</p>

<p>"His love for my mother was the green spot on
which he stood apart from the commonplaces of a
mere bread-winning existence. She was one of those
fair, flowerlike natures, which sometimes spring up
even beside the most dusty highways of life. Of all
persons whom I have known, she had in her most of
the angelic."</p>

<p>It was not surprising therefore that Margaret should
have inherited a beautiful nature and a fine mind.
She became the idol of her father, who was fifty years
in advance of his neighbors in his ideas of bringing up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>girls. Mr. Fuller believed that his daughter should
have as good an education as his boys! But since there
were no girls' colleges, and the boys' colleges were closed
to them, he was obliged to teach Margaret himself.</p>

<p>At six years of age this clever child began to read
Latin. Once, when she was eight, her father found
her so absorbed in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> that she did
not hear him when he spoke to her. It is probable
that much of Margaret's later ill-health was the result
of the severe mental work demanded of her in
childhood by her father.</p>

<p>Mr. Fuller was certainly very ambitious that
Margaret should excel in her studies. Often she
remained up until late at night reciting to him, not
knowing that she was working beyond her strength.</p>

<p>She describes her life at the age of fifteen in the
following manner:</p>

<p>"I rise a little before five, walk an hour, and then
practice on the piano until seven, when we breakfast.
Next, I read French till eight; then two or three
lectures in Brown's Philosophy. About half past
nine, I go to Mr. Perkins's School and study Greek
till twelve, when, the school being dismissed, I recite,
go home, and practice again till dinner at two.
Then when I can, I read two hours in Italian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>Though frail in body and plain in looks, this young
girl grew to be a fascinating and attractive woman.
Men and women of prominence fell under the influence
of her charms. At seventeen, her unusual
intellectual qualities gained her the friendship of
Rev. James Freeman Clark; and later she became a
valued friend of the Emerson family.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-three, Margaret taught in the
famous school of Mr. Alcott in Boston. Through
working with this great educator, she met most of
the gifted men and women of the time. Elizabeth
Peabody, another remarkable woman, to whom we
are indebted for bringing Froebel and the Kindergarten
into notice in the United States, became
Margaret's friend, and together these two labored
to revive intellectual thought among women.</p>

<p>When Mr. Alcott ceased teaching, Margaret became
Principal of a school in Providence, Rhode
Island. But longing to become better educated
herself, she resigned from her position to give private
lessons in the higher branches, meanwhile studying
languages. So great were her acquisitive powers
that before long she had a good teaching knowledge
of Latin, Greek, German, French, and Italian.</p>

<p>Her greatest gift was her ability to entertain people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>by conversing with them. Deeply interested in the
welfare of women, her talent for talking led her to
open a "School of Conversation." A large number
of intelligent, educated women met in the home of
Miss Elizabeth Peabody where, led by Margaret Fuller,
they discussed important books and philosophical
subjects. Her idea was to induce women to do something
worth while with their knowledge.</p>

<p>These <em>Conversations</em> were ridiculed by the community
at large, yet they were continued successfully
for five years, and attracted many serious and
intellectual women who felt the need of mental
activity. At last the <em>Conversations</em> became an old
story, and Margaret looked about for other occupation.
One came to her in the form of an editorial
position on the New York Tribune offered her by
Horace Greeley, the editor-in-chief. She used her
pen, also, for the benefit of the people, writing editorials
to influence the rich to help the poor, the
unjust to become just. She also translated books
from foreign languages, and kept a journal which was
published after her death.</p>

<p>In 1847, Miss Fuller went to Rome to live, and
while there met a handsome young Italian named
Giovanni Angelo, the Marchese d'Ossoli. This gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>tleman
had been discarded by his family for his part
in a political movement led by Mazzini for the independence
of Italy. His troubles attracted Margaret
to him, they became attached to each other, and
finally married.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, to keep the marriage a
secret, Margaret being a Protestant. During the siege
of Rome by the French army in 1849, Margaret, still
known as Miss Fuller, took an active part in hospital
work, spending the greater part of her time in nursing
the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>The Marchese d'Ossoli, had charge of the battery
on Pincian Hill, the most exposed of all positions.
Such great fear was felt for the men stationed there
that Margaret summoned Mr. Cass, the American
minister at Rome, and gave him certain letters and
papers. He was astonished to learn from these that
she was married to d'Ossoli, and that the package
contained the certificate of their marriage and that
of the birth and baptism of their child; also that
she intended to go to the Pincian Hill, remain with
her husband and die with him if necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Cass willingly took charge of these papers,
and watched the Marchese and Margaret walk away
together as if on a pleasant stroll. They survived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>the night, however, and next morning the French
army entered Rome. Soon after, the Marchese and
Marchesa with their child left Rome for Florence, to
sail for America as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It is recorded that both dreaded the voyage, as
d'Ossoli had been told by a fortune-teller to avoid
the sea, and Margaret had a strong presentiment
of disaster.</p>

<p>They sailed May 5, 1850, and from the first the
voyage was a bad one. The captain died of small-pox
and had to be buried at sea. Then wind-storms
delayed them; and when little Angelo was taken ill
with small-pox, the agony of the parents may be
imagined. The child recovered, but on July 19,
during a terrific gale, the vessel was wrecked off Fire
Island, and Margaret, her husband, and her child
were lost.</p>

<p>A trunk containing papers and manuscripts belonging
to Margaret was picked up, and in this way
her relatives and friends came to know the true history
of her life abroad.</p>

<h2>HARRIET BEECHER STOWE</h2>

<p class="center">(1811-1896)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works
praise her at the gates."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Solomon</em></p>
</div>


<p>Few women's names have made so vivid a mark
upon the history of our country as that of Harriet
Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin.</p>

<p>On June 14, 1811, in the little town of Litchfield,
Connecticut, Harriet first saw the light of day. She
was the seventh child, the eldest being but eleven years
of age. Just two years after Harriet was born came
a little brother, Henry Ward, who became the renowned
pastor of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Harriet's father, the Reverend Lyman Beecher, was
a man of marked ability, and her mother, Roxanna
Beecher, was a woman whose beautiful life has been
a help to many. The family was a large one to be
supported on a salary of five hundred dollars a year,
and in order to assist, Roxanna Beecher started a
select school, where she taught French, drawing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>painting and embroidery, as well as the higher English
branches.</p>

<p>A great grief came to little Harriet, when she was
between three and four, in the death of her mother.
Certain things in connection with this event, as the
funeral, the mourning dresses, and the walk to the
burial ground, never left her memory. Her little mind
was confused by being told that her mother had gone
to heaven, when Harriet had with her own eyes seen
her laid in the ground. Her brother Henry suffered
likewise from this confusion of thought. He was
found one day in the garden digging diligently.
When his elder sister Catherine asked him what he
was doing, he answered: "I'm going to heaven to
find mamma!"</p>

<p>When Harriet was six, her father married again.
At first the little girl, who had loved her own mother
so dearly, felt very sad about this; but she afterward
learned to love and respect her new mother.</p>

<p>Harriet had a remarkable memory. At seven she
had memorized twenty-seven hymns and two long
chapters in the Bible. She read fluently, and continually
searched her father's library for books which
might interest her. Very few did she find there, however.
Most of the titles filled her childish soul with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>awe, and she longed for the time when she could understand
and enjoy such works as Bonnett's <cite>Inquiries</cite>,
Bell's <cite>Sermons</cite>, and Bogue's <cite>Essays</cite>.</p>

<p>One day good luck befell her. In the bottom of a
barrel of old sermons she came upon a well-worn
volume of <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>. Imagine her joy!
A world of enchantment opened to her. When <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>
fell in her way, she and her brother George
read it through, together, seven times.</p>

<p>It was in the school of Mr. John P. Brace that
Harriet discovered her taste for writing. Her compositions
were remarkable for their cleverness; when
one of them was read at the entertainment at the
close of the year, Harriet's cup of joy was full to the
brim.</p>

<p>About this time Harriet's elder sister, Catherine,
opened a school in Hartford. The circumstances
which led her to do so were very sad. Catherine,
who was remarkably gifted, had been engaged to
Professor Fisher of Yale, a brilliant and promising
young man. These young people expected to be
married on the return of the Professor from a European
trip. But the vessel on which he sailed was
wrecked, and he never came back.</p>

<p>This almost prostrated Catherine, but her strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>nature rose to meet the blow. She determined to
devote her life to the work of helping girls. After
hard work she raised several thousands of dollars
and built the Hartford Female Seminary, where
girls studied subjects heretofore taught only in boys'
colleges, and received an education more on an equality
with that given to boys.</p>

<p>People of that time wondered what use girls would
make of Latin and philosophy, but Miss Beecher's
able management of the school and her womanly and
scholarly attainments so filled them with admiration
that they gladly put their daughters in her charge.
Here also entered twelve year old Harriet, not only
as a pupil, but a pupil teacher, that she might help
her father in paying the expenses of his large family.
The experience of Harriet in this school was of
much use in after life. She had to master problems
without any assistance from others, and in doing
this, she became self-reliant.</p>

<p>About ten years after this, her father was called
to become President of Lane Theological Seminary
at Cincinnati, Ohio. Catherine and Harriet felt
bound to go with him, to help him in the new field of
work. The journey, made by stage-coach across
the mountains, was very tiresome. They settled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Walnut Hills, a suburb of Cincinnati, where the
sisters opened another school.</p>

<p>In 1836, Harriet married Calvin E. Stowe, professor
of Biblical Criticism and Oriental Literature in
the Lane Seminary. Mr. Stowe, together with other
intelligent men in Ohio at that time, was much
interested in the advancement of education in the
common schools. In order to study the question
and to purchase books for the Lane Seminary, Mr.
Stowe was sent abroad. This happened shortly after
his marriage.</p>

<p>During his absence Harriet lived in Cincinnati
with her father and brother, writing short stories and
essays for publication and assisting her brother, Henry
Ward, who was then editing a small daily paper.</p>

<p>The question of slavery had become an exciting
topic in Cincinnati. Being near the borderland of
Kentucky, a slave state, this city naturally became
the center of heated discussions. Many slaves who
escaped sought refuge in Cincinnati, and people who
were friendly to their cause assisted them to reach
Canada, where they were safe from capture by their
so called masters.</p>

<p>Among the students of Lane Seminary were both
Northerners and Southerners, and many fierce de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>bates
as to the rights and wrongs of slavery were
carried on in that institution. The feeling was very
intense and excitement ran high. Dr. Bailey, an
editor who attempted to carry on in his newspaper
a fair discussion of the slavery question, had his
presses broken and thrown into the river.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe took into her family, as servant, a
colored girl from Kentucky. Though by the laws of
Ohio this girl was free, having been brought into the
state by her mistress and left there, yet it was rumored
that some one had come to the city from over
the border hunting for her, with the intention of
taking her back into slavery. Mrs. Stowe and Henry
Ward Beecher drove the poor girl by night twelve
miles into the country and left her with an old friend
until such time as the search for her should be given
up. This incident served Mrs. Stowe as the basis
of her description in <cite>Uncle Tom's Cabin</cite> of Eliza's
escape from Tom Loker and Marks.</p>

<p>Houses of free colored people were burned and even
Lane Seminary stood in danger from the mob. Mr.
Stowe and his family slept with firearms at hand ready
to defend themselves if necessary. When the trustees
of the college forbade all discussion of the question of
slavery, nearly all the students left the institution.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>Then Mrs. Stowe opened her house to colored
children and taught them. One boy in her school
was claimed by a master in Kentucky, arrested and
put up at auction. Mrs. Stowe raised sufficient
money to buy him and gave it to his distracted
mother, who thus saved him. Heart-rending incidents
like this were continually brought to the attention
of the Stowe family, until at last they felt unable
to endure the situation. They decided to come North
where Mr. Stowe accepted a position in Bowdoin
College, Maine.</p>

<p>Very poor was the Stowe family in those days. Mrs.
Stowe earned a little now and then, by her writings,
and from a few boarders. She had now apparently
all she could do, with a family of young children
whom she herself taught, with her writing, and with
caring for the strangers in the house; but even so,
she could never get out of her mind those wretched
creatures, her brothers and sisters, who were being
bought and sold. What could she do for them?</p>

<p>The most frequent topic of conversation everywhere
was the proposed law called The Fugitive
Slave Act. This law would give the slave-holders of
the South the right to bring back into slavery any colored
person claimed as a slave, and also commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>the people of the North to assist in the business
of pursuit. Public feeling grew more and more
heated, but the law was passed. After its passage
many pitiable scenes occurred. The Stowe and
Beecher families received frequent letters telling
of shocking incidents. Families were broken up,
children sold and sent far from their parents, while
many slaves who ran away perished from cold and
hunger.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Stowe received a letter from her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Edward Beecher, which she read
to her family. When she came to this passage: <em>Now,
Hattie, if I could use a pen as you can, I would write
something that would make the whole nation feel what
an accursed thing slavery is</em>, Mrs. Stowe stood up, an
expression upon her face which those who saw it
never forgot.</p>

<p>What she said, however, was simply, "I <em>will</em> write
something! I will, if I live!"</p>

<p>Some months after this Mrs. Stowe was seated
at communion in the college church at Brunswick,
when the scene of the death of Uncle Tom passed
through her mind as clearly as in a vision. She hastened
home, wrote out the chapter on his death, as
it now stands, and then read it to her assembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>family. Her two sons aged eleven and twelve years
burst out crying, saying, "Oh, mamma! Slavery
is the most cruel thing in the world!"</p>

<p>When two or three more chapters were ready, she
offered it for publication to Dr. Bailey, then in
Washington, and <cite>Uncle Tom's Cabin</cite> was first published
as a serial in his paper <cite>The National Era</cite>. For
it Mrs. Stowe received three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>When completed, it was published by Jewett of
Boston, in March, 1852, meeting with instant success.
In ten days ten thousand copies were sold. Thirty
different editions appeared in London in six months,
and it was translated into twenty foreign languages.
It was dramatized, and several theaters were playing
it at one time. In less than a year over three hundred
thousand copies were sold.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe "woke up to find herself famous,"&mdash;not
to say wealthy. Letters of congratulation poured
in upon her from all parts of the world. Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert sent hearty thanks.
Charles Dickens wrote, "Your book is worthy of any
head and any heart that ever inspired a book."
Charles Kingsley wrote, "It is perfect!"</p>

<p>The poet Whittier wrote to Garrison, "What a
glorious work Harriet Beecher Stowe has wrought!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>Thanks for the Fugitive Slave Law! Better would
it be for slavery if that law had never been enacted,
for it gave occasion for <cite>Uncle Tom's Cabin</cite>!"</p>

<p>Longfellow also wrote in praise of the book, and
letters were received from most of the noted men
who opposed slavery.</p>

<p>The possibility of making money by the publication
of this book was quite remote from Mrs. Stowe's disinterested
mind. As she wrote in a letter to a friend:
"Having been poor all my life, and expecting to be
poor for the rest of it, the idea of making money by a
book which I wrote just because I could not help it,
never occurred to me." But from this time forth
she was to be free from the anxieties of poverty.
As the first payment of three months' sale, Mrs.
Stowe received ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The following year Professor and Mrs. Stowe went
to Great Britain, having been urgently invited to
visit in many Scotch and English houses. Even in
foreign lands, Mrs. Stowe found herself known and
loved. Crowds greeted her in Liverpool, Glasgow,
Edinburgh and London. Children ran ahead of her
carriage, throwing flowers to her, and officials of the
Anti-Slavery Societies met her and offered hospitality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>A national penny offering, turned into a thousand
golden sovereigns, was presented to her on a magnificent
silver salver for the advancement of the cause
for which she had written. This offering came from
all classes of people.</p>

<p>A personal gift which Mrs. Stowe valued highly
was a superb gold bracelet presented by the beautiful
Duchess of Sutherland who entertained her at Stafford
House. It was made in the form of a slave's
shackle and bore the inscription, "We trust it is a
memorial of a chain that is soon to be broken." On
two of the links were already inscribed the dates of
the abolition of slave trade and of slavery in the
English territories. Years afterward, on the clasp
of the bracelet, Mrs. Stowe had engraved the date
of the Constitutional Amendment abolishing slavery
in the United States.</p>

<p>Upon Mrs. Stowe's return from her visit to Europe
in the autumn of 1853, she became very active in
public affairs. She supported anti-slavery lectures,
established schools for the colored people, assisted
in buying ill-treated slaves and setting them free, and
arranged public meetings for the advancement of
anti-slavery opinions, using the money which had
been given to her in England to support the work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>In addition, she kept up a correspondence with influential
men and women on the subject of the abolition
of slavery.</p>

<p>The books she wrote after this were <cite>Sunny Memories
of Foreign Lands</cite>; <cite>Dred</cite>, a great anti-slavery story;
<cite>The Minister's Wooing</cite>; <cite>Agnes of Sorrento</cite>; <cite>The Pearl
of Orr's Island</cite>; and <cite>Old Town Folks</cite>. All have been
widely read, but <cite>Uncle Tom's Cabin</cite>, though lacking in
literary form and finish, written as it was at white
heat and with no thought of anything but its object,
remains her greatest work. It made the enforcement
of the Fugitive Slave Law impossible, by making
people see slavery in all its inhumanity.</p>

<p>In addition to her books, Mrs. Stowe wrote an
appeal to the women of America, in which she set
forth the injustice and misery of slavery, begging all
thoughtful women to use their influence to have the
wicked system abolished. Here are a few paragraphs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What can the women of a country do? Oh! women
of the free states, what did your brave mothers do in
the days of the Revolution? Did not liberty in those
days feel the strong impulse of woman's heart?</p>

<p>For the sake, then, of our dear children, for the sake
of our common country, for the sake of outraged and
struggling liberty throughout the world, let every
woman of America now do her duty!</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>Nobly, indeed, did the women of America respond
to her call, for during the Civil War, which was begun
before the abolition of slavery was an accomplished
fact, the women, though they went not to the war
themselves, loyally sent out their fathers, husbands
and brothers. Who shall say these women were not
heroic?</p>

<p>After the close of the Civil War, Mrs. Stowe purchased
a home in Florida overlooking the St. John's
River, where she lived during the winter, going in
summer to her old home in Hartford.</p>

<p>On her seventieth birthday, June 14, 1882, her publishers,
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin Company, of
Boston, gave a reception for her in the form of a
garden party at the beautiful residence of ex-Governor
Claflin of Massachusetts in Newtonville,
one of Boston's fine suburbs. Here gathered men
and women well known in the literary and artistic
world, eager to do honor to the woman whose life
had been such an inspiration to others, and whose
work of such benefit to mankind. Mr. Houghton
made an address of congratulation and welcome, to
which Henry Ward Beecher replied. Oliver Wendell
Holmes spoke, and many poems and letters from
noted persons were read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>This was the last public appearance of Mrs. Stowe.
Her husband died in August, 1886, and she herself,
passed away July 1, 1896, at Hartford, at the age
of eighty-four. She was buried in the cemetery of
the Theological Seminary at Andover, Massachusetts,
next to her husband.</p>

<h2>MARIA MITCHELL</h2>

<p class="center">(1818-1889)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the cultivation of women's minds depends the wisdom
of men."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Richard Brinsley Sheridan</em></p>
</div>


<p>Maria Mitchell was born on the Island of Nantucket,
Massachusetts, August 1, 1818, and to-day
if you go there, you may see a monument erected to
her memory.</p>

<p>Her ancestors were Quakers who had fled hither
from Massachusetts because of religious persecution.
Nantucket Island then belonged to New York State,
and here these good people were free to worship God
as they pleased. Almost all of the inhabitants of
the Island belonged to the Society of Friends, from
which sect have sprung many of our notable men
and women, among them John G. Whittier, "the
Quaker Poet," who all his life wore the Quaker garb
and spoke the language of that religious society.</p>

<p>The Mitchell family were not very strict; that is,
they did not wear the plain clothes of the sect, al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>though
they probably used the "thee" and "thou."
Maria's mother was a woman of great strength of
character. Her father was a kindly gentleman, whose
affection for his children was so great that he could
refuse them nothing. Often Mrs. Mitchell was obliged
to check him, fearing they would be spoiled by his
indulgence.</p>

<p>The little girls were brought up to be industrious.
They learned to make their own clothes by
making those of their dolls, and frequently they made
their own dolls, too, the eldest sister painting the
faces.</p>

<p>Maria received the first rudiments of her education
from her mother and an excellent woman teacher,
but not until she entered her father's school, at the
age of eleven, did she begin to show marked ability
as a student.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell was greatly interested in the study
of astronomy, and owned a small telescope, which he
used to examine the heavens at night. Maria was
especially fond of her father's pursuit. She also had
a taste for mathematics, without which astronomy
as a science cannot be mastered, and she watched,
patient and absorbed, when her father would compute
distances by means of his scientific instruments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>There was no school in the country where Maria
Mitchell could be taught higher mathematics, so she
continued to study with her father.</p>

<p>Every fine night the telescope was placed in Mr.
Mitchell's back yard, and the neighbors would come
in to gaze through it at the moon and the planets.
Little Maria was always on hand listening for scraps
of information.</p>

<p>In 1831, and while Maria was still a child, there occurred
a total eclipse of the sun at Nantucket. With
her father, Maria observed this eclipse through a new
Dolland telescope which had been recently purchased
and, for the first time in her life, counted the
seconds of the eclipse. At that time she was studying
with Mr. Cyrus Pierce, who took a great interest
in her, and who helped her in her mathematics.</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen she left school, becoming for
a while an assistant teacher, but she soon gave up
teaching to accept the new position of librarian in the
Nantucket Atheneum. This post she continued to
fill for twenty years. She had much time while acting
as a librarian to study her favorite subject, and
she used the opportunity to advantage.</p>

<p>Every evening Miss Mitchell spent on the housetop
"sweeping" the heavens. One memorable even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>ing,
October 1, 1847, she had put on her old clothes
and taken her lantern to the roof as usual. After
gazing through her telescope for a few minutes, she
observed an object which she concluded must be a
comet. Hurriedly she called her father, who also
examined the unusual body in the heavens and agreed
with her that it was a comet.</p>

<p>He immediately announced the discovery to Professor
Bond of Cambridge. It was learned afterward
that the same comet had been seen in Rome by an
astronomer on October 3, and in England by another
on October 7, and still later in Germany. To Maria
Mitchell was given the credit of the first discovery, and
she received the gold medal which had been promised
by the King of Denmark to the first discoverer
of a telescopic comet. This brought her letters of
congratulation from astronomers in all parts of the
world.</p>

<p>Miss Mitchell had always had a desire to travel
abroad, and as her tastes were simple she soon saved
enough from her small salary to enable her to do so.
During her visits in foreign countries, she met many
eminent scientists, among them Herschel, Airy, Mrs.
Somerville, and Humboldt. The plain Nantucket
lady was perfectly at home in the society of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>distinguished people, whose tastes and occupations
were similar to her own. They all opened their
observatories for her inspection and their homes for
social intercourse.</p>

<p>The Greenwich Observatory especially interested
Miss Mitchell. It stands in Greenwich Park, which
comprises a group of hills with many beautiful oak
trees which are said to date back to the time of
Queen Elizabeth. The observatory was then in
charge of Sir George Airy, who showed Miss Mitchell
all the treasures of the place, among them the instruments
used by the great astronomers Halley, Bradley,
and Pond. The meridian of Greenwich is the zero
point of longitude for the globe, and you can perhaps
imagine the pleasure which Miss Mitchell experienced
in being on the spot where time is set for the whole
world.</p>

<p>Miss Mitchell became Professor of Astronomy and
Director of the Observatory at Vassar College, where
her work gave the subject a prominence which it has
never had in any other woman's college. She was
not only a famous astronomer, but a noble, inspiring
woman, much interested in the higher education of
women and devoting much of her time to advancing
this work. Many a young girl can trace the success
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>of her life work to the impulse she received from
Maria Mitchell.</p>

<p>At the age of sixty-nine Miss Mitchell's health
began to fail and she resigned her position in the
College, going to live at her home in Lynn, Massachusetts,
where she died June 28, 1889.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h2>LUCY STONE</h2>

<p class="center">(1818-1893)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Woman is a creation between men and the angels."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Honor&#233; de Balzac</em></p>
</div>


<p>In the town of West Brookfield, Massachusetts, in
1818, lived a farmer, named Francis Stone, and his
wife, a gentle and beautiful woman, whose life was
spent in devotion to her husband and in aiding him
in his work on the farm. Mrs. Stone worked continuously
from early morning until late at night,
often milking eight cows after the necessary housework
was done. The family consisted of seven children.
When, on August 18th, the eighth was born, and
Mrs. Stone was told that the new baby was a girl, she
said, "Oh, dear! I am sorry it is a girl. A woman's
life is so hard!"</p>

<p>It seems as if this little girl, who was called Lucy,
must have understood her mother's words, for, as she
grew up, she showed very clearly that she intended
to try to make life easier for all women. Her childhood
was spent in doing useful work about the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>and on the farm. She cooked, swept, dusted, made
butter and soap. She drove the cows, planted seeds,
weeded the garden,&mdash;in short, was never idle. But
all the time she worked in this way, Lucy was thinking
deeply and comparing her life with that of her brother
at college. She pondered deeply over questions like
the following:</p>

<p>Why are not girls permitted to earn their living
like their brothers?</p>

<p>Why is it that mother works so hard, and father
has all the money?</p>

<p>Why are boys given the great benefits of a college
education and girls refused it?</p>

<p>She could think of no satisfactory answers. At
last, gathering up her courage, she asked her father
to assist her to go to college like her brothers. Mr.
Stone was both astonished and angry. He told
Lucy that it was enough for her to learn how to read
and cipher and write, as her mother did. But Lucy
persisted in her determination to gain an education.
She earned a little money by picking berries and
gathering chestnuts, and with it she bought some
books. Her mother could not help her, for, though
she worked very hard, she had not a penny to bless
herself with. Her husband took all that came in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>through their joint labors, and spent it as he thought
best.</p>

<p>When Lucy had learned enough to fit her for
teaching, she got a position in a district school at a
salary of one dollar per week. A little later she was
earning sixteen dollars a month, and when her brother,
who received thirty dollars a month for teaching,
became ill, Lucy took his place, receiving sixteen
dollars for exactly the same work. The committee
said that sixteen dollars was enough for a woman.</p>

<p>Lucy Stone studied for a while at Mt. Holyoke
Seminary under Mary Lyon, and also at Wilbraham
Academy, and later at Oberlin College, Ohio, which
was then the only college in the country willing to
admit women,&mdash;all the while paying her own tuition
fees by means of teaching and doing housework in
boarding houses.</p>

<p>When the question of slavery came into prominence,
Lucy Stone quickly took her position as a friend of the
slave. She taught in a school for colored people,
which was established at Oberlin, and her first public
speech was made in their behalf. Though severely
criticized for her public speaking and obliged to bear
unpleasant comment because of it, she never swerved
from her idea of what she believed to be right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>Soon she was engaged by the Anti-Slavery Society,
in which William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell
Phillips were officers, to lecture for their cause, and
while doing so, traveled over the greater part of the
United States, speaking both for woman suffrage and
for the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>But the rights of woman stood first in the heart of
Lucy Stone. As a child, she had seen her mother
overruled by a stern husband, who never allowed her
an opinion contrary to his will, nor a penny to use
without his sanction.</p>

<p>It may have been because of this early object
lesson that Lucy Stone made up her mind never to
marry; or because she thought that she could carry
on her work for the advancement of women better by
being entirely free. Nevertheless, she did consent
to marry Mr. Henry B. Blackwell, a merchant of
Cincinnati, Ohio, who overcame her objections by
sharing all her views on suffrage and slavery, and
they were married by Rev. Thomas Wentworth
Higginson, May 1, 1855.</p>

<p>Before their marriage Mr. Blackwell and Lucy
signed a protest which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We believe that personal independence and equal
human rights can never be forfeited except for crime;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>that marriage should be an equal and permanent partnership
and so recognized by law.</p></div>

<p>This protest was the beginning of much serious
thought about the rights of man and woman as individuals,
and led the way to improved laws. In
most states, to-day, a married woman may own
her own property and may will a part of it away from
her husband, if she wishes to; she may live an individual
life, also, and control equally with her husband
the education of their children.</p>

<p>Lucy Stone retained her maiden name, never adopting
that of her husband. Their married life proved
to be remarkably happy, one child, a daughter, being
born to them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone helped to organize the American Equal
Rights Association, which grew into the American
Woman Suffrage Association. William Lloyd Garrison,
George William Curtis, Colonel Higginson, Julia
Ward Howe, and other prominent people joined in
the work with her. She served as President of the
New England Woman Suffrage Association, and
even studied law that she might learn how to correct
legal injustice to women. In 1877, Mrs. Stone and
Mr. Blackwell went to Colorado to assist in the
Woman Suffrage movement in that state. Sixteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>years later the constitutional amendment granting the
suffrage to woman was carried by popular vote, and
women were given "exactly the same rights as men
in exercising the elective franchise."</p>

<p>Lucy Stone did not live to see success in Colorado,
but she did see school suffrage gained in twenty-two
states, and full suffrage in Wyoming. She lived, also,
to see many great colleges admit women.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1893, Mrs. Stone was obliged to
rest from her labors. A little later she wrote Mrs.
Livermore, her devoted friend and co-worker: "I
have dropped out, and you will go on without me!
Good-by. If we don't meet again, never mind. We
shall meet sometime, somewhere; be sure of that."</p>

<p>She passed away in the presence of her husband
and her daughter, Alice, on October 18. Her gentleness
and sweetness of character had made her beloved
by all, and her great work for the advancement of
woman in intellectual, social, and political life will
never be forgotten.</p>

<h2>JULIA WARD HOWE</h2>

<p class="center">(1819-1910)</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">"We all are architects of fate,<br /></div>
 <div class="indent4">Working in these walls of time,<br /></div>

<div class="indent4">Some with ornaments of rhyme."</div>
<div class="right">&mdash;<em>Henry W. Longfellow</em></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Julia Ward Howe was born May 27, 1819, in
New York City. Her father, Samuel Ward, was a
wealthy banker, and her mother a descendant of the
Marions of South Carolina, being a grand-niece of
General Marion.</p>

<p>Both parents came from families of refined and
scholarly tastes, and little Julia directly inherited
her love of good books. Her mother died at an
early age, leaving six little children, Julia, the fourth,
being then only five years old.</p>

<p>Julia, who from babyhood had given promise of
superior intellectual attainments, received special
attention from her father. Mr. Ward was anxious
that she should know the joy which only true knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>edge
and right living can give. He did not wish
her to become merely a fashionable girl with no
thought of doing anything in life but amuse herself.
Every advantage was given her, therefore, for reading,
and the best teachers in music, German, and
Italian were selected for her.</p>

<p>Julia well repaid this care. She showed great
fondness for books, and at nine years of age was
studying Paley's <cite>Moral Philosophy</cite> in a class with
girls twice her age. At fourteen, she was an accomplished
musician. Her friends thought she should
devote her life to music, but she was equally fond
of literature. At sixteen she wrote her first poem.
Her brother, Samuel Ward, Jr., shared in all her
tastes, and together the brother and sister enjoyed
the society of the most noted musicians and literary
men and women of the day, the poet Longfellow being
one of their closest friends.</p>

<p>The death of their beloved father brought a change
in the home, and the family went to live with an
uncle, Mr. John Ward. Julia continued to spend
her time in the cultivation of her mind and in the enjoyment
of the fine arts. She excelled in the study
of the German language, reading Goethe, Schiller,
Swedenborg, Kant, and other great German poets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>and philosophers, and translating much of their work.
She wrote many verses and began to dream of publishing
a play.</p>

<p>In Boston, Julia Ward was a welcome addition to
the circle of distinguished literary people then living
there. She met Margaret Fuller, Horace Mann,
Charles Sumner, Ralph Waldo Emerson. All were
charmed with the brilliant and intellectual young
woman from New York. Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe,
a philanthropist and reformer, was one of this delightful
group.</p>

<p>Dr. Howe, a graduate of Brown University, was
deeply interested in the Greek War for Independence.
He went to Greece to offer his services as a surgeon
and for the purpose of organizing hospitals, but later
took such an active part in the war that he endeared
himself to the Greeks for his assistance and sympathy.
Contracting a fever, however, he was obliged to
leave Greece for a better climate. For some time
he traveled abroad, studying and attending lectures.</p>

<p>But to help others was his sole object in life. At
that time there were no schools for the blind in the
United States. Through Dr. Howe's influence, men
of wealth became interested in this matter and helped
him to establish such a school. Going again to Europe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>to investigate such schools in foreign lands, he was
temporarily turned aside from his project by the
condition of Poland, oppressed as it then was by
Prussia. In consequence of the assistance he gave
this unhappy country, he was arrested, and imprisoned
for some time.</p>

<p>All the world knows now of Dr. Howe through his
kindness to Laura Bridgman, a child, who at the age
of two years, and before she had learned to speak,
became blind and deaf through a severe illness.
When she was about eight, Dr. Howe took her into
his home and taught her to read, write, do needlework,
and play the piano. His success with Laura
was so great that he, later, gave almost his entire
energy to work for feeble-minded children and in
this accomplished many wonderful results.</p>

<p>Dr. Howe fell in love with Julia Ward. Two such
souls could hardly meet and not love each other.
Though he was eighteen years older than she, similar
tastes and aims naturally united them.</p>

<p>Their marriage took place when Julia was twenty-four
years of age. Soon after the wedding, Dr. and
Mrs. Howe made an extensive tour of Europe. For
five months they lived in Rome, where their first
child was born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>On their return to Boston, Dr. Howe bought a
large estate near the Institute for the Blind, of which
he was a Director, and in this happy home were born
five more children. While a devoted mother, Mrs.
Howe still found time to continue her studies, reading
the Latin poets and the German philosophers, and
all the while writing essays and poems for the magazines.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty-five she published her first
volume of poems entitled <cite>Passion Flowers</cite>, and
two years later, another called <cite>Words for the Hour</cite>.
She also assisted her husband in editing the <cite>Boston
Commonwealth</cite>, an anti-slavery newspaper, for in this
cause both became leaders, being associated with
Garrison, Sumner, Phillips, Higginson, and Theodore
Parker.</p>

<p>In 1862, Mrs. Howe published in the <cite>Atlantic
Monthly</cite> her best known poem, <cite>Battle Hymn of
the Republic</cite>. This inspiring hymn reached the prisoners
in Libby Prison through Chaplain McCabe,
who sang it to celebrate a victory of the Union troops.
After Chaplain McCabe was released from prison,
and while he was lecturing in Washington, he narrated
this incident. This attracted the attention of
the public, so that the beautiful hymn soon became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>popular throughout the country. Later, it became
the battle cry of the Union army, being sung by the
men as they marched into action.</p>

<p>When Colonel T. W. Higginson urged Mrs. Howe to
sign a call for a Woman Suffrage Convention to be held
in Boston, she not only signed, but attended the Convention,
and later became intimately associated with
the movement, often making speeches on the subject.</p>

<p>She was a delegate to the Congress for Prison
Reform in England, where, besides speaking earnestly
against the flogging of prisoners, she also urged arbitration
as the means of settling international disputes.
In her own country, she organized the Women's Peace
Festival, with the object of turning the attention of
women to the horrors and needlessness of war. Thus
we find this remarkable woman always in the van of
progress and generally much ahead of her time.</p>

<p>In 1876, after a brief illness, Dr. Howe died. Mrs. Howe then took
her daughter Maud to Europe, where she remained for two years, trying
by travel to dull the sharp edge of her affliction. It was at this
time that Mrs. Howe took up the study of Greek, in which she became
very proficient, and the study of which she kept up until her last
illness.</p>

<p>For a long period of years Mrs. Howe lectured and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>wrote on subjects which concerned the social improvement
of mankind.</p>

<p>Almost her last appearance in public was at the
reception given to the representatives of twenty-seven
nations by the Hudson-Fulton Celebration Commission
at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York
City. Mrs. Howe read an original poem written for
the occasion. While she read, the entire audience
stood respectfully, and as she sat down, all joined in
singing the <cite>Battle Hymn of the Republic</cite>. Her
really last appearance in public was but two weeks
before her death, at the inauguration of the second
president of Smith College, at which function she
was given the degree of LL. D.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howe died October 18, 1910, at her country
place in Portsmouth. She will long be remembered
for her work in the anti-slavery cause and for the advancement
of woman, for her literary merits, and
for her beautiful domestic life.</p>

<h2>QUEEN VICTORIA</h2>

<p class="center">(1819-1901)</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">"Her court was pure; her life serene;<br /></div>
 <div class="verse">God gave her peace; her land reposed;<br /></div>

<div class="right">&mdash;<em>Alfred Tennyson</em></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On May 24, 1819, a little girl was born in Kensington
Palace, London, who received the name of
Victoria. Her father, Edward, the Duke of Kent,
was the fourth son of King George <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>.</p>

<p>At the time of Victoria's birth it seemed unlikely
that she would ever become queen. Between her
and the crown stood three uncles and her father.
But when, in January, 1820, within a few days of
each other her father and the King died, it began to
be seen that Victoria would in all probability become
the future ruler of England. In consequence, her
education was conducted with the greatest care. Her
mother, the Duchess of Kent, devoted herself to the
child and made every effort to develop in her all that
was good and noble.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>Victoria lived a quiet and natural life in the open
air, having for instructor a tutor who was a clergyman
of the Church of England. When lessons were over,
the little Princess used to go out into Kensington
Gardens, where she rode a donkey gaily decked with
blue ribbons. Here she also walked, and would
kiss her hand to the children who sometimes gathered
about and looked through the railing to see
a real Princess.</p>

<p>Victoria was very fond of dolls. She had one hundred
and thirty-two, which she kept in a house of
their own. She herself made their clothes, and the
neatness of her needlework surprised all who saw it.
The Princess grew up a merry, affectionate, simple-hearted
child, thoughtful for the comfort of others,
and extremely truthful.</p>

<p>Victoria's baptismal name was Alexandra Victoria.
She preferred to be called by the latter name, but to
the English people "Victoria" had a foreign sound and
was not very popular. It remained for the Queen to
make it illustrious and beloved.</p>

<p>By the death of George <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr> in 1830, William, Duke
of Clarence, came to the throne. As he had no children
who might succeed to the throne, Victoria
became the direct heir. King William was a good-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>natured,
undignified sort of man, often ridiculous in
his public actions. He encouraged Victoria to take
part in public ceremonies, and if there was a hall to
be dedicated, or a bridge to be opened, or a statue
unveiled, the little Princess was called upon quite
often to act for the King at the ceremony.</p>

<p>William reigned only nine years, expiring one morning
in June, 1837, at Saint James's Palace in
London.</p>

<p>When a king or queen dies, it is the custom for
persons of high rank to go immediately and salute
the new king or queen.</p>

<p>As soon as William, therefore, had drawn his last
breath, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord
Chamberlain went straight to Kensington Palace
to notify Victoria that she had succeeded to the
throne. It was five o'clock in the morning, and as
she had just arisen from bed, she received them in
her dressing-robe. Her first words to the Archbishop
were, "I beg your Grace to pray for me." There is
a pretty picture of this scene in the Tate Gallery in
London, representing the two old men on their knees
before a young girl of eighteen years, kissing her
hands.</p>

<p>And so, at the age of eighteen, Victoria became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and the Empire
beyond the seas. Though not beautiful, the young
Queen was self-possessed, modest and dignified.
Every one bore testimony to the dignity and grace of
her actions at this time.</p>

<p>Victoria selected as her Prime Minister Lord Melbourne,
to whom she was much attached, and who
was her trusted adviser for many years. Just eight
days after the first anniversary of her accession to the
throne, Victoria was crowned in Westminster Abbey,
sitting in the chair where so many English monarchs
have received their crowns. The coronation was of
great splendor. The sun shone brightly as the procession
left Buckingham Palace and her Majesty was
greeted all along the route with enthusiastic cheers.</p>

<p>When the Queen entered the Abbey, "with eight
ladies all in white floating about her like a silvery
cloud, she paused as if for breath and clasped her
hands." When she knelt to receive the crown, with
the sun shining on her fair young head, the beauty
and solemnity of the scene impressed every one. The
Duchess of Kent, Victoria's mother, was affected
to tears. The ceremonies in the Abbey lasted five
hours and the Queen looked pale and weary as she
drove to the Palace wearing her crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>Carlyle, who was among the spectators, said:
"Poor little Queen! She is at an age when a girl
can hardly be trusted to choose a bonnet for herself.
Yet a task is laid upon her from which an archangel
might shrink."</p>

<p>Many important matters had to be decided by the
young Queen, and sometimes serious troubles grew
out of her inexperience. However, being sensible
and wise beyond her years, her decisions were for the
most part just, and with time she became more and
more tactful and better able to cope with the difficulties
of governing so great a nation.</p>

<p>A matter of great interest to the public was Victoria's
marriage. There were many princes willing
and anxious to marry the young Queen of England,
but Victoria had a mind and will of her own. She
remembered with interest her handsome cousin,
Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who had visited
England two years before, while she was still a
Princess.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Kent had been fond of this nephew,
whose tastes were refined and whose habits were good.
Victoria herself remembered him with affection.</p>

<p>Another visit was arranged by King Leopold, and
this time Victoria's interest grew into love. One day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>she summoned the Prince to her room and offered
him her hand in marriage. It must have been a trying
thing for her to do, but of course a mere Prince
could not propose to the Queen of England. Prince
Albert was overjoyed, for he loved Victoria.</p>

<p>The Queen announced her engagement to Parliament,
and on February 10, 1840, she was married
in the Chapel Royal of Saint James's Palace. She
wore a white satin gown trimmed with orange blossoms
and a veil of Honiton lace costing one thousand
pounds, which had been ordered to encourage the lace-makers
of Devonshire. Guns were fired, bells rung,
and flags waved, when the ceremony was completed.</p>

<p>After the wedding breakfast at Buckingham Palace,
Victoria and Albert drove to Windsor Castle,
past twenty-two miles of spectators, who shouted
and cheered the youthful pair. There was great
rejoicing, and dinners were given to thousands of
poor people throughout the Kingdom. After three
days spent at Windsor, the Queen and the Prince
Consort, as Albert was called, returned to London
and began their busy life for the state.</p>

<p>Victoria found a wise adviser in her young husband.
He was about her own age, and like her, had a sincere
desire always to do the right thing. For a while he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>was not liked in England, owing to his foreign birth,
but before long he gained the affections of that exacting
people. The married life of Victoria and Albert
was one of unusual happiness and beauty, lasting
for twenty years,&mdash;until 1861. The Prince, in dying,
left a family of nine children. The eldest became
the Empress of Germany, and the second was the
late King Edward.</p>

<p>The death of the Prince Consort made a great
change in the life of the Queen. She became very
reserved in her widowhood, and her withdrawal from
public life lasted a long time, to the displeasure of
the English people. She wore mourning for many
years, and was averse to presiding over ceremonious
Court functions.</p>

<p>Although impetuous and wilful, Victoria was yet
quite willing to be advised by older and wiser persons,
and the great men of England very soon learned to
respect her character and give heed to her wishes.
As a Queen, she really reigned; which means that
she was the true head and controller of public affairs.
Naturally, she could not do it all herself, but she had
the fortunate gift of knowing how to choose her
helpers. No reign of any English monarch can be
reckoned so great as that of Victoria. It was full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>great events, which would require several volumes
to recite.</p>

<p>In 1849 she paid a visit to Ireland. In 1851 the
first great World's Exposition was held in London.
In 1853 there was a war with Russia, and in 1857
the Indian Mutiny occurred. Years later, in 1876,
Victoria was formally proclaimed Empress of India.
This was accomplished by means of the clever management
of Lord Beaconsfield, her Prime Minister, who
was a Jew named Disraeli, and a very great statesman.</p>

<p>She encouraged artists and literary men. She made
Alfred Tennyson the Poet Laureate of England.
Some of his most beautiful lines were addressed to her
and the Prince Consort.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, victor at Waterloo, where
Napoleon was defeated, was her trusted friend and
adviser.</p>

<p>England, in Victoria's reign, made great strides in
wealth, art, science, and population. Great men
clustered around this wonderful little woman and
helped make her rule a glorious one. In 1887, when
she had been queen for fifty years, England gave herself
a great jubilee which was attended by all the great
princes and representatives of kings in the world.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria was fond of music, was an excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>singer, and spoke many languages. When in London
she lived at Buckingham Palace, going at times to
Windsor Castle, and occasionally to Balmoral Castle
in Scotland, where she would throw off the cares of
state and live simply as an English gentlewoman.
She had another pleasant home on the Isle of Wight,
called Osborne House, where she had her last illness.</p>

<p>Victoria died on January 22, 1901, in her eighty-second
year. Her reign was the longest in English
history, being nearly sixty-four years. It was exceeded
in Europe only by Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr> of France, who
reigned seventy-one years.</p>

<p>The English people mourned Victoria sincerely
and deeply. She had added greatly to the extent
and glory of her country. She had been a great and
wise ruler. She had commanded the respect of
every one at home and abroad, and while she did not
talk much, her life proved that a woman can rule as
well and wisely as a man. Her private life, as mother,
wife, and sovereign, has been a noble example.</p>

<p>At her own request, Queen Victoria's funeral was a
military one, her body being placed in the mausoleum
built for Prince Albert at Frogmore.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<h2>FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE</h2>

<p class="center">(1820-1910)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Theirs is a heroism and patriotism no less grand than that
of the bravest soldier they ever nursed back to life and health."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Charles R. Skinner</em></p>
</div>


<p>Florence Nightingale, one of the most illustrious
personages of Queen Victoria's reign, was born in
Florence, Italy, of English parents. Since they were
visiting that city at the time, they named their little
daughter after the city of her birth. A sister, also
born in Italy, was named Parthenope after her birthplace.</p>

<p>The Nightingales were well-to-do people. They
owned a beautiful country seat in Derbyshire, which
was for many years the residence of Florence and her
parents. Florence's love for animals and flowers was
second only to her love of humanity. Very early
she formed the idea of a vocation which should be
lofty and altruistic.</p>

<p>Her acquaintance with Elizabeth Fry did much
to develop this idea. Mrs. Fry, already famous as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>the first woman who made the welfare of women
in prison her care, was a preacher of the Quaker
sect.</p>

<p>Having decided upon her course, Miss Nightingale
began to learn in the hospitals the medical nurse's
duties; and, hearing of a German training school
for nurses at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine, she went
thither and enrolled herself as a "deaconess."</p>

<p>Kaiserswerth had been started in a very small way
by Pastor Fleidner. It was a Protestant school,
which combined religious teaching with charitable
work among the poor and outcast. The Pastor himself
was poor, but his devotion to his work attracted
many helpers who gave him money to carry it on.</p>

<p>Florence here became interested also in prison
reform, which led her to open a small home for women
after they should come out of prison. The few
years she spent here brought her face to face with
much suffering and want, and taught her how to
find and help unfortunate people.</p>

<p>From Kaiserswerth she went to Paris and entered
a Catholic Convent to study the methods of the Sisters.
While there she learned to respect and admire
so greatly the love and devotion of the nuns, that
afterwards, in the Crimean War, she called upon them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>to assist her. In England once more, Miss Nightingale
settled down to a quiet life, devoting herself to
the care of the sick and the poor about her.</p>

<p>Living near the Nightingales, were Sidney Herbert
and his wife. Herbert, who afterwards became Lord
Herbert of Lea, was made Secretary of War in the
English Government. The post was no sinecure, for
almost immediately after his appointment, war broke
out between Russia on one side and England, France,
and Turkey on the other.</p>

<p>The scene of the fighting was on the border where
Turkey and Russia join. Near this border is the
Crimea, a peninsula, whose principal city is Sebastopol.
To capture this city was the object of the
fighting in that part of the country, from which fact
the whole war is known as the Crimean War.</p>

<p>England had lived in peace since 1815, a period of
forty years, and had to some degree lost the practical
knowledge of how to conduct a military campaign.
The result was a great waste of time, men and stores,
through the inexperience of both officers and soldiers.
Disaster followed disaster, each treading upon the
other's heels.</p>

<p>Finally William Howard Russell, the War Correspondent
of the London Times, wrote a strong letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>home to England in which he spoke of the suffering
of the wounded, saying: "For all I can see, the men
die without the least effort to save them."</p>

<p>Food and clothing were lost, or delayed in transport;
the surgeons were without lint or bandages or
other of the commonest supplies for hospital work.
Russell finally asked a question that made a great
stir in England:</p>

<p>"Are there no devoted women among us, able and
willing to go forth to minister to the sick and suffering
soldiers of the East? Are none of the daughters of
England at this extreme hour of need ready for such
a work of mercy?"</p>

<p>Florence Nightingale heard this clarion cry and
immediately wrote to Secretary Herbert offering her
services. Her letter crossed one from him offering
her the place of Chief Nurse.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if any choice of a person to do a great
work has ever been so fortunate and successful as
this one. Florence Nightingale, by her studies and
her work in Germany and at home, was already well
prepared for nursing. Now it was seen that she
was an able organizer as well.</p>

<p>All this came as a great surprise to the world, for
Miss Nightingale had never been written or talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>about very much. Now, however, every one asked
who she was.</p>

<p>She gathered together thirty-eight nurses, ten of
whom were Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy, and
they all left England on October 21, 1854.</p>

<p>On landing in France, the fish-women of Boulogne
cared for their trunks and luggage with their own
hands and saw the Englishwomen safely on the train
for Paris, where they made a short stay at the Convent
which Florence had visited years before. Then
they set forth for Marseilles, where they took steamer
for Scutari, in Turkey. Every one helped them and
no one would take pay for their service.</p>

<p>There was no little fun made in Europe over the
nurses, but ridicule changed to admiration when the
first news of their work began to reach home. Miss
Nightingale paid no attention either to the shallow
fault-finding, or to praise, but went straight ahead
to do the work she found in Scutari. And great
need there was of her help!</p>

<p>It might be well here to quote a description of
Florence Nightingale:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You cannot hear her say a few sentences, no, not
even look at her without feeling that she is an extraordinary
being. Simple, intellectual, sweet, full of love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>and benevolence, she is a fascinating and perfect woman.
She is tall and pale. Her face is exceedingly lovely, but
better than all is the soul's glory that shines through
every feature. Nothing can be sweeter than her smile.
It is like a sunny day in summer.</p></div>

<p>It would be difficult and painful to describe the conditions
she found existing in the hospital at Scutari.
The doctors were so few and so overworked, and the
wounded men were so numerous, that many died who
might have been saved. Hospital supplies were there,
but could not be found. Perhaps never in civilized
times was there so much unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>Miss Nightingale and her staff of nurses could do
very little compared to the great need, but they
took up the work bravely. Here Miss Nightingale's
ability as a manager and director was shown. She
soon came to be ranked with the Generals in ability
and power. All opposition to her as a woman began
to fade away as her blessed work among the sick
and dying soldiers began to be appreciated.</p>

<p>Soon all England was alive to the great work, and
more nurses, and large gifts of supplies and money
began to be hurried to the Crimea.</p>

<p>Florence Nightingale spent nearly two years in the
Crimea. Once she fell dangerously ill with a fever,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>but the care she had given to others was returned
in the form of all manner of attentions to her.
She never quite recovered from the effects of that
terrible Crimean fever.</p>

<p>When the war was over, she went back to England
so quietly that hardly anyone outside her home knew
of her return. When it became known, she was
overwhelmed by all sorts of people trying to do her
honor. Most of them she refused to see. Queen
Victoria invited her to come to Balmoral Castle and
this honor she could not refuse, for the request of a
Queen is a command. The Queen decorated her
with a beautiful jewel, treating her simply in the
spirit of one woman recognizing another who deserved
recognition.</p>

<p>Florence Nightingale lived to be ninety years old,
thus spending fifty years in England after the Crimean
war.</p>

<p>She devoted all her life to benevolent works:
building new hospitals, writing books on the care of
the sick, and inspiring many young women to give
their lives to the service of humanity. She never
married.</p>

<p>At her death it was proposed to bury her in Westminster
Abbey, that great final home of England's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>illustrious sons and daughters, but the honor was
declined by her friends, and she sleeps sweetly in
the village church-yard near her old country home
in Hampshire.</p>

<p>Our own Longfellow wrote these fine lines about
Florence Nightingale, referring to her habit of going
about the hospitals at night with a lamp in her hand:</p>

<p>It has been truly said that woman's place is in the
home, and true it is that most women prefer home
life; yet does not every one know that, in numerous
instances, women are compelled to earn their own
living, and often in addition to support their brothers
and sisters, fathers and mothers?</p>

<p>"Why, then," thought Miss Anthony, "should laws
be such as to prevent women from having the same
opportunities as men in the business world?" This
line of thought was early forced upon her.</p>

<p>Born on the fifteenth of February, 1820, in South
Adams, Massachusetts, of Quaker ancestry, she re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>ceived
a liberal education from her father. Mr.
Anthony being a well-to-do merchant, it was not
supposed that his daughters would ever be obliged
to support themselves, but he believed that girls as
well as boys should be fitted to do so, if the necessity
arose.</p>

<p>The wisdom of Mr. Anthony's course early became
apparent, for when Susan was seventeen years of age,
he failed in business, and his daughters were able
to assist him to retrieve his fortunes.</p>

<p>Susan began to teach in a Quaker family, receiving
the sum of one dollar a week and board. Later she
taught in the Public Schools of Rochester, to which
place the family had removed. Here she received
a salary of eight dollars a month for the same work
for which men were paid twenty-five and thirty
dollars.</p>

<p>It was this injustice which first led her to speak
in public. At a meeting of the New York State
Teachers' Association, she petitioned the Superintendent
for equal pay with men, but notwithstanding
the fact that her work was admitted to be entirely
satisfactory, her petition was refused on the ground
that she was a woman.</p>

<p>Miss Anthony worked for years trying to bring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>wages of women workers up to those of men, and
although she did not succeed in accomplishing her
desire, still by her efforts the general standing of
women was greatly improved.</p>

<p>She continued to teach until 1852, but all the while
she was taking a keen interest in every reform movement.
The more she studied and pondered over the
condition of women, the stronger grew her conviction
that they would never receive proper pay or
recognition, never be able to do the work God intended
them to do in the world, unless they should
be given equal political rights with man.</p>

<p>Miss Anthony did not at first advocate full suffrage
for women; at that period it appeared a thing quite
impossible for them to obtain. Wisely she worked
for what she believed was within the range of possibility
to secure. She was much interested in the
temperance movement, and spoke frequently in
public for that cause. It happened one day that
the Sons of Temperance invited the Daughters of
Temperance to their Convention at Albany. The
Daughters accepted the invitation and attended, but
the Sons would not allow them to speak,&mdash;which so
angered Miss Anthony and some other women that
they left the hall and held a meeting of their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>outside. Out of this episode grew the Women's
New York State Temperance Society, founded in
1852, and afterward developing into the Women's
Christian Temperance Union.</p>

<p>By this time Miss Anthony was well known as a
lecturer. But when she actually called a Convention
of Women at Albany to urge the public to recognize
the wrongs, and demand the rights of her sex, considerable
comment followed. In the sixth decade of
the Nineteenth Century women had not become so
active in public affairs that one of them could call a
Convention and the general public take no notice.</p>

<p>The right to vote on educational questions was at
length granted women in New York State, and the
credit for this is due to Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton.</p>

<p>Miss Anthony's friendship with Mrs. Stanton
started her in new fields of action. Mrs. Stanton's
husband was a lawyer and journalist, who had been
a student in Lane Theological Seminary. A noted
abolitionist, he went as delegate to the World's Anti-Slavery
Convention in London. Mrs. Stanton accompanied
him, meeting there Lucretia Mott, who
was the sole woman delegate. These two women
called the first Woman's Rights Convention at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>Seneca Falls in 1848. Though Miss Anthony did
not attend this meeting, she later became a complete
convert, being already headed in the direction of
woman's political and social emancipation.</p>

<p>As soon as Miss Anthony became convinced that
only through the use of the ballot could woman succeed
in obtaining the same rights in the business
world as men, she entered heart and soul into the
work of securing it, going to many cities of the North
and the South to lecture, often speaking five or six
times a week. Her platform manner was direct,
straight-forward, and convincing; her good humor,
unfailing; her quickness to see and grasp an opportunity
for retort, noteworthy.</p>

<p>In 1860 the New York Legislature passed a bill
giving to married women the possession of their earnings
and the guardianship of their children. This
was largely due to Miss Anthony's exertions. For
many years she had kept up a constant agitation
on the injustice of depriving women of these fundamental
rights.</p>

<p>Belonging to the Abolition Party, she had worked
during the war with the Women's Loyal Legion for
the abolition of slavery. In 1867 Mrs. Stanton,
Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony went to Kansas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>in the interests of woman suffrage; there the three
women secured nine thousand votes in favor of the
cause. Their work, however, had no immediately visible
effect, but to-day, forty-five years later, women
in that State enjoy the privilege of the ballot.</p>

<p>As a citizen of Rochester wishing to test her right
to the suffrage, she voted at the National election of
1872. For so doing she was arrested, tried, and
fined one hundred dollars and costs. With her
characteristic defiance of injustice, Miss Anthony
refused to pay the fine, which to this day remains
unpaid.</p>

<p>Beloved by her co-workers, to strangers Miss
Anthony appeared stern and uncompromising. Yet
all her friends testify to her lovable qualities and
generous nature. Mrs. Stanton, her intimate friend
for eighteen years, said of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She is earnest, unselfish, and as true to principle as
the needle to the pole. I have never known her to do
or say a mean or narrow thing; she is entirely above
that petty envy and jealousy that mar the character of
so many otherwise good women.</p></div>

<p>Miss Anthony herself said, "My work is like subsoil
ploughing&mdash;preparing the way for others to perfect."</p>

<p>But the last eight years of her long life, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>she worked constantly and achieved much, must have
given her the satisfaction of knowing that all the
"subsoil ploughing" had not been in vain. Her
constancy in keeping the idea of votes for women
before the public won many over to the cause, and
paved the way for the partial victory of to-day. At
present, women have the privilege of the ballot in
ten States of the Union: California, Colorado, Idaho,
Utah, Wyoming, Washington, Arizona, Oregon, Kansas,
and Michigan. It is clear that the question
of woman suffrage has ceased to be a mere matter
of academic discussion and that it is a very practical
and even vital issue to-day.</p>

<p>For years Miss Anthony endured cruel misrepresentation
and ridicule; now she is acknowledged to
have been a woman of splendid intellect and wonderful
courage, who devoted her life to the betterment
of humanity.</p>

<p>To her co-workers she was always "Aunt Susan,"
and when her last illness came, there were many
loving friends to care for her. The Reverend Anna
Howard Shaw was with her when she died at Rochester,
March 16, 1906. She says, "Miss Anthony died
with calmness and courage. She spent her life in
making other women freer and happier."</p>

<h2>MARY A. LIVERMORE</h2>

<p class="center">(1821-1905)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am not accustomed to the language of eulogy. I have
never studied the art of paying compliments to women. But I
must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets
since the Creation of the World, in praise of women, was
applied to the women of America, it would not do them justice
for their conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God
bless the women of America."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Abraham Lincoln</em></p>
</div>


<p>The life of Mary A. Livermore shows how a poor,
unknown girl became famous, the world over, as
an orator and reformer.</p>

<p>Mary Rice was born in Boston, Massachusetts, December
19, 1821. Her parents were stern Calvinists,
her grandfathers for six generations having been Welsh
preachers. Hence, Mary was brought up "after the
strictest sect a Pharisee." She was a restless, active
child, fond of play, yet interested in work. At an early
age she was sent to a Public School in Boston, where
she made rapid progress in her studies, being quick to
learn and persistent and enthusiastic over her tasks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>Her class-mates were fond of her, and by reason of
an unusually strong character, she became a leader
among them. The poor or unfortunate always appealed
to her. If ever a girl appeared in the school
wearing shabby clothes or eating a scanty luncheon,
Mary would manage to prevent her from feeling
uncomfortable. It is not surprising that she was a
favorite.</p>

<p>In out-of-door sports she excelled most of the girls,
being famous for running, jumping and sliding. One
day, after she had spent a happy hour at her favorite
sport of sliding on the ice, she ran into the house exclaiming,
"Splendid, splendid sliding!"</p>

<p>Her father replied, "Yes, Mary, it is good fun, but
hard on the shoes!"</p>

<p>This led the child to believe that her father's
burden was increased by her amusement, so she decided
that she would never slide again. When ten
years of age she grew so deeply anxious for the
spiritual welfare of her five little brothers and sisters
that she could not sleep. She would crawl out of bed
at night and beg her father and mother to arise and
pray for their conversion, once saying: "It is no
matter about me; if they can be saved, I can bear
anything."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>Even in her play she would devise means of instructing
as well as entertaining the children. There
being no money to buy toys for them, Mary introduced
the game of playing school. It is said that she
imitated her own teacher to perfection. Sometimes
in the old woodshed she arranged the logs to represent
the pews of a church, and desiring a larger audience
than that of the children, she stood up sticks of wood
to represent people. Then, when the assemblage was
sufficiently large to warrant a service, she would conduct
one herself, praying and preaching with the
utmost seriousness.</p>

<p>Her mother, surprised at her ability in this line,
once said to her, "Mary, I wish you had been a boy;
you could have been trained for the ministry!"</p>

<p>In those days no one even thought of educating
a girl to speak from the pulpit, though to-day it is
not uncommon; nor could Mrs. Rice dream that her
daughter would one day become a powerful public
speaker in an important cause, and deliver speeches
in lecture halls and churches.</p>

<p>When Mary was twelve, she resolved to assist her
father in supporting the large family, for she had
observed with sorrow how hard he worked. Dressmaking
seemed to offer good opportunities, so she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>entered a shop as apprentice. In three months she
had learned her trade, and was then hired at thirty-seven
cents a day to work three months more, but
being desirous of earning more money, she engaged
to make a dozen flannel shirts at home for a clothier.
After sewing all day in the shop and sitting up at
home until early morning hours, she could not finish
the shirts in the time agreed upon.</p>

<p>One evening the man called for them, greatly to
Mrs. Rice's surprise, for she had known nothing about
Mary's plan. Mary explained the delay, promising
to have the shirts finished the next day. When the
clothier had left, Mrs. Rice burst into tears. "We
are not so poor as that, my dear child! What will
become of you if you take all the cares of the world
upon you?" she said.</p>

<p>Mary completed the shirts, took them to the clothier
and received the sum of seventy-five cents. This
ended her experience as a seamstress, for her mother
would not permit the child to continue such work.</p>

<p>At fourteen, Mary was graduated from the Public
School, receiving a gold medal for good scholarship.
She then entered the Charlestown Female Seminary,
where she became one of the best scholars in the
institution. Her ability was so pronounced, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>when one of the teachers died, she was at once asked
to take the vacant position. She conducted her class
with much tact and wisdom, earning enough to pay
for the four year course, which she completed in
two, by studying and reciting out of school hours.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen, she took a position as
governess in the family of a wealthy Virginia planter.
Her object was not altogether teaching; she wished
to investigate for herself the slavery question, which
was then much discussed by Abolitionists. She had
heard the lectures of Lucretia Mott and John G.
Whittier and determined to find out if the facts were
as bad as stated. Her two years' experience in Virginia
made her an uncompromising Abolitionist.</p>

<p>The faculty of the Duxbury High School was in
need of a Principal. It was customary to place men
in such positions, but Mary Rice's fame had made its
way to Duxbury. They had heard of her as an unusual
young woman and one of the most learned of
the day. So Mary was placed over the High School,
and there she remained until she was twenty-three
years old, when she resigned to become the wife of the
Reverend D. P. Livermore, a young minister, two
years her senior, whose church was near her school.</p>

<p>Mary immediately began to co&#246;perate with Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>Livermore in his work. For thirteen years she assisted
him in the affairs of his parish, during which
time three children were born to them. She started
literary and benevolent societies among the church
members and was active in the cause of temperance,
organizing a club of fifteen hundred boys and girls
which she called the "Cold Water Army."</p>

<p>In 1857 the Livermores removed to Chicago. Mrs.
Livermore while there aided in editing the <cite>New Covenant</cite>,
a religious paper, at the same time writing
stories and sketches for many Eastern publications.
In 1860, when Abraham Lincoln was nominated for
the Presidency, Mrs. Livermore was the only woman
present,&mdash;probably the first woman representative of
the press who ever reported a political convention.</p>

<p>The breaking out of the Civil War changed her
life of domestic quietness to public activity. Being
in Boston at the time that the President called
for volunteer troops, she witnessed their departure
for the seat of war. The sad scenes at the station,
where mothers parted from sons, and wives from their
husbands, affected her strongly. As the train carrying
the soldiers started off, some of the women
fainted. Mrs. Livermore helped to revive them,
telling them not to grieve, but rather to be thankful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>that they had sons to fight for their country. For her
part, she told them, she grieved to have no son to send.</p>

<p>Then a question arose in her mind: What <em>could</em>
women do to help? The general feeling seemed to
be that women could do nothing, since they were not
allowed to enlist and fight as soldiers. They were
told they were not wanted in the hospitals, but notwithstanding
this a large number of women banded
together and formed "The United States Sanitary
Commission," whose object was to provide bedding,
clothing, food, and comforts for the soldiers in camp,
and supplies for the wounded in the hospitals.</p>

<p>Branch associations were formed in ten large cities.
Mrs. Livermore and Mrs. Jane C. Hoge were put in
charge of the Northwestern branch. Together with
others Mrs. Livermore went to Washington to talk
with President Lincoln. They asked him the question,
"May women go to the front?"</p>

<p>Lincoln replied, "The <em>law</em> does not <em>grant</em> to any
civilian, either man or woman, the privilege of going
to the front."</p>

<p>The emphasis he placed upon the words <em>law</em> and
<em>grant</em> convinced these women that he would not disapprove
of their plans. So Mrs. Livermore entered
hand, heart and soul into the work of relief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>The North was entirely unprepared for war. The
hospitals were few and poorly equipped; nurses were
scarce and not well trained; there were no diet kitchens;
nor was there any way of supplying proper
medicines to the sick or of caring for the wounded.
To all of these matters Mrs. Livermore gave her
attention; the confusion came to an end, and soon
the machinery of the new department was running
smoothly.</p>

<p>She formed soldiers' aid societies; enlisted nurses
for the hospitals and took them to their posts; she
went to the front with supplies, and saw that they
were properly distributed; she nursed and cheered
the wounded soldiers, and often brought back invalids
with her to their homes. With all this work, she
kept cheerful and well, and found time to write letters
of comfort and cheer to the families of the sick. In
one year she wrote seventeen hundred letters, many
being from dying soldiers, and containing their last
farewell to loved ones at home.</p>

<p>The Sanitary Commission was permitted in time
of battle to keep its wagons in the rear of the army.
Hot soup and hot coffee were kept in readiness, cool
water and medicines were given when necessary,
while the mere fact that brave women were ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>assist the wounded, put confidence into the hearts
of the men.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the great work done by
this untiring woman. Mrs. Livermore tells about
it in her book called <cite>My Story of the War</cite>, which is
said to be the best account of the hospital and sanitary
work of the Civil War that has ever been written.</p>

<p>This work took a great deal of money. Donations
must be constantly solicited and Sanitary Fairs
arranged. From all parts of the country, people
were writing and begging Mrs. Livermore to come
to them and tell them about her plans. She frequently
did describe them in an informal way to
small audiences.</p>

<p>Her first public speech was made in Dubuque,
Iowa, where she had consented to address some ladies.
Leaving Chicago by the night train she reached the
Mississippi River at a point where there was no
bridge, travelers being obliged to cross by ferry. It
was very cold and the ice in the river had stopped
the ferryboats. Mrs. Livermore, after waiting nearly
all day, began to think she would not be able to
keep her engagement. At last she saw two men
starting out in a small boat, whom she asked to row
her across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>One man said, "No, we can't think of it! You'll
be drowned!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Livermore replied, "I can't see that I shall be
drowned any more than you!"</p>

<p>Her offer to pay them well settled the matter.
This determination to accomplish whatever she undertook
to do was the chief reason for Mrs. Livermore's
success in all her undertakings. The fact is, she
liked to do hard things.</p>

<p>Upon her arrival at Dubuque she found that the
ladies had made great preparations to receive her.
They had invited the Governor of the State and
many noted men, and the largest church in town was
crowded with eager people. This rather alarmed
her. At first she refused to speak, saying that she
had come to talk to a few ladies only; that she had
never made a speech in her life. But when they said
that by speaking she might be the means of inducing
the great State of Iowa to enter upon the work of
Sanitary Relief, her shyness departed and she held
her audience spellbound for an hour and a quarter.
A new power had suddenly developed in her.</p>

<p>At the close of her address the Governor of the
State arose and said,</p>

<p>"Mrs. Livermore has told us of the soldiers' needs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>and of our duties! It is now our turn to speak, and
we must speak in dollars and gifts!"</p>

<p>The enthusiasm was great; eight thousand dollars
was soon pledged and other donations were made.
It was decided to hold a Sanitary Fair in Dubuque,
and Mrs. Livermore was engaged to speak in different
towns throughout the State to interest the people
in it. When the fair was held, sixty thousand dollars
was cleared. After that, Mary Livermore was never
again afraid to speak before a large audience. By
her lectures she raised hundreds of thousands of
dollars for the hospital work.</p>

<p>At the close of the war, people were so anxious to
hear Mrs. Livermore that she became a regular public
lecturer, traveling from place to place and lecturing
always before crowded houses. Her eloquence has
been equaled by few modern speakers, and undoubtedly
she was the foremost of women orators.</p>

<p>Before the war, Mrs. Livermore had been opposed
to woman suffrage, but life in the army caused her
to change her views on that question. She saw that,
under existing political and social conditions, women
could never hope to complete reforms until they
possessed the right to vote. She was also devoted
to the cause of temperance, serving for ten years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>as President of the Women's Christian Temperance
Union of Massachusetts. All this while she was
writing articles for magazines, and at the age of
seventy-five Mrs. Livermore produced a book of seven
hundred pages, entitled <cite>The Story of My Life</cite>.</p>

<p>A bust of Mrs. Livermore, made by the sculptor,
Annie Whitney, was presented to the Shurtleff School
in Boston by the Alumnae Association of that institution.
It stands opposite that of Lucy Stone, which
was the first bust of a woman ever accepted by the
city of Boston for its schools.</p>

<p>Mrs. Livermore continued in public work, while
living at her beautiful home in Melrose, Massachusetts,
until May 23, 1905, when she passed away at
the age of eighty-four.</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h2>CLARA BARTON</h2>

<p class="center">(1821-1912)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"She was on the firing line for humanity all her life."</p></div>


<p>The Red Cross Society, whose object is to relieve
the sufferings caused by war, is well known the world
over, and the name of Clara Barton must ever be
associated with it.</p>

<p>This Society was founded in Europe in 1864, but
did not make its way to America until 1881, when
Clara Barton succeeded in establishing it.</p>

<p>Born in the town of North Oxford, Massachusetts,
on Christmas Day, 1821, Clara Barton began life
under most favorable circumstances.</p>

<p>The family was well-to-do and Clara, being the
youngest, received much attention from all. Her
father, who had fought under Mad Anthony Wayne
against the Indians of the West, used to tell her
stories of army life&mdash;knowledge which she afterward
turned to good account.</p>

<p>Her elder brother was fond of mathematics, and
insisted upon teaching Clara the mysteries of num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>ber.
These she mastered rapidly and soon no toy
equaled her little slate in her esteem.</p>

<p>Her younger brother, David, was a fearless and
daring rider. On the farm were several fine
horses, for Mr. Barton was fond of the animals and
raised his own colts. It was David's delight to take
little Clara, throw her upon the back of a colt and
spring upon another himself. Then, shouting to her
to "cling fast to the mane," he would catch hold of
her by one foot and together they would gallop
away. What mad rides they took, and how well
Clara learned to stick on a horse's back! These
lessons, too, she had cause to be thankful for later in
life, when she was obliged to mount a strange horse on
the battle-field and ride fearlessly to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Her two sisters, who were teachers, took care that
she should have a knowledge of books. Miss Barton
said that she did not remember the time when she
could not read; she always did her own story reading.</p>

<p>When old enough she was sent to an academy at
Clinton, New York, where she graduated. She then
became a teacher and opened the first free school in
the State of New Jersey, at Bordentown. Here her
work was very successful, her school numbering at
the close of the first year six hundred pupils. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>her health failing, she gave up the school work in 1854
and obtained a position as Head Clerk in the Patent
Office at Washington.</p>

<p>When the Civil War broke out, she offered her
services as a volunteer nurse, and from the beginning
of the war until its close she worked in the hospital,
in the camp, and on the battle-field.</p>

<p>During the Peninsula campaign in 1862, Miss
Barton faced horrible scenes on the field. She also
served eight months in the hospitals on Morris Island
during the siege of Charleston, and was at the front
during the Wilderness campaign. In 1864 she was
put in charge of the hospitals at the front of the Army
of the James, and continued that work until the close
of the war.</p>

<p>All this time Miss Barton persisted in aiding the
wounded soldiers of <em>both</em> armies&mdash;a practice which
shocked many people and caused them to protest.
But she paid no attention to the protests, nor are
any such heard to-day, for Clara Barton's way of
helping the suffering, regardless of the uniform they
wore, is now followed over the civilized world; it is the
very heart of the plan of the Red Cross Society itself.</p>

<p>War over, and peace assured to our land, President
Lincoln requested Miss Barton to search for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>eighty thousand men whose names were on the
army records, but of whom no trace could be found.
In the course of this work, Miss Barton visited the
prison at Andersonville and helped the released prisoners
to regain their health and their homes. She
laid out the ground of the National Cemetery at that
place, identified the dead, and caused marked gravestones
to be placed over the bodies of twelve thousand
nine hundred men. Four hundred tablets,
marked "Unknown," were placed over the bodies of
other dead soldiers.</p>

<p>This Work took four years to accomplish, and when
it was over Miss Barton went to Switzerland for rest.
Here she first heard of the Red Cross Society. The
idea had originated with a Swiss, M. Henri Dunant.
Each European country had signed a treaty permitting
the members of this association to help all
the wounded on the battle-field without interference,
and without regard to religion or race, or whether
they were friends or foes.</p>

<p>Miss Barton devoted herself to this work during
the Franco-Prussian War. After the siege of Strasburg,
when the people of that city were in a terrible
condition, she organized a relief fund for the starving,
and saw to it that the homeless were given places to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>sleep. Materials for garments were obtained, and
the poor women were set to work at a fair price to
make articles of wearing apparel for the needy.</p>

<p>When no longer needed in Strasburg, Miss Barton
went to Paris, where the breaking out of the French
Revolution after the war with Prussia had caused
great distress. She entered the city on foot, for it
was impossible to procure a horse, thousands having
been slain to use as food for the starving inhabitants.
Miss Barton immediately began relief work there,
with such success that she came to be looked upon
as an angel.</p>

<p>In 1873, on her return to America, she asked Congress
to join in a treaty with the European powers to
establish the Red Cross Society here. It took a long
time to secure this legislation, and it was not until
1881, as stated before, that the Red Cross was established
with us. Clara Barton was chosen as the
first President and soon afterward she had an amendment
passed widening the scope of the Society so
as to include cases of suffering from floods, fires,
famine, earthquake, and other forms of disaster.
The amendment also gave protection to all Red Cross
workers. This was agreed to at a conference of the
Society held at Berne in 1882, but was not adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>by any of the European nations. At that time there
was little possibility of a war in the United States,
and Miss Barton thought she would have little to
do unless she extended the plan of work. As it was,
she found quite enough to do.</p>

<p>The forest fires in Michigan, the Mississippi Valley
floods, 1882-1883, the Charleston earthquake, the
Johnstown flood&mdash;all afforded much work for the
Red Cross. During the famine in Russia, 1891-1892,
Miss Barton and her Society took an active
part in distributing food and clothing. When the
frightful massacres in Armenia brought horror to the
civilized world, again Miss Barton made an appeal to
a European country to be allowed to help the sufferers.
The Sultan at first objected, but public opinion was
too strong for him, and he finally consented on condition
that the workers should place the crescent above
the cross on the badges worn by them. Miss Barton
and her assistants were then pleasantly received and
succeeded in giving valuable aid.</p>

<p>In 1898 President McKinley sent Miss Barton to
Cuba to help the poor people of that country, many
of whom were starving. During the Cuban War
which followed, she went to the battle-fields and did
heroic work there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>When the Galveston flood occurred, Miss Barton
was eighty years old. Yet to Galveston she hastened.
The strain, however, was more than she could
endure. From that time she gave up active work
and made her home in Glen Echo, a small village in
Maryland. Here, enjoying the companionship of a
few faithful friends, she spent the remainder of her
life, passing away on April 12, 1912.</p>

<p>Miss Barton possessed one of the most remarkable
collections of medals and other decorations in existence.
They were presented to her by nearly every
country on the globe. Many are set with rare jewels
and bear inscriptions. Among them is the Iron Cross
of Germany, the highest honor Germany can bestow,
and one conferred only for deeds of great personal
bravery. A rare jewel, which Miss Barton always
wore, was a pansy cut from a single amethyst, presented
to her by the Grand Duchess of Baden in
memory of their lifelong friendship.</p>

<p>Clara Barton ranks as one of the greatest heroines
the world has known. Her name is known and
loved throughout Europe and America for unselfish
devotion to a great cause. Her services in foreign
lands were offered as freely as in her own country, for
her creed was the brotherhood of man.</p>

<h2>HARRIET HOSMER</h2>

<p class="center">(1830-1908)</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="right">... "A sculptor wields<br /></div>
 <div class="verse">The chisel, and the stricken marble grows</div>
<div class="verse">To beauty." ...</div>
<div class="right">&mdash;<em>Bryan</em></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Harriet Goodhue Hosmer was born in Watertown,
Massachusetts, October 9, 1830. She was the youngest
child of Hiram and Sarah Grant Hosmer. From
her father came her marked independence of character;
from her mother, her imagination and artistic
tastes.</p>

<p>The latter died when Harriet was four years of age.
Dr. Hosmer determined to save his daughters from
the insidious disease which had carried away his two
sons as well as his wife, and so instituted for them a
system of physical training, insisting upon out-of-door
sports and amusements. Notwithstanding all
his efforts, however, the elder daughter died, leaving
Harriet as the sole surviving child.</p>

<p>Dr. Hosmer, grieved, but undismayed, renewed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>endeavors to strengthen Harriet's vigor and increase
her powers of endurance. Harriet took to this treatment
very kindly, spending many joyous days tramping
through the woods with her dogs. All the while,
she observed keenly, acquiring a knowledge of plant
and animal life, and storing up impressions of the
beautiful and harmonious in Nature.</p>

<p>Her home was situated on the Charles River. She
had her own boathouse and bathhouse. In summer
she rowed and swam; in winter she skated. No nook
or corner of the country round was unknown to her;
the steepest hills, the wildest and most rugged regions,
were her familiar haunts. A madcap was Harriet,
and the sober neighbors were often astonished and
even scandalized, by the undignified speed she made
on her beautiful horse.</p>

<p>This kind of life would always have satisfied her,
and Harriet thought it nothing short of an affliction
when her father said she must go to school. Was
she not getting her education in riding about the
country? However, to school she went, in Boston,
for several years.</p>

<p>But when she reached the age of fifteen, Dr. Hosmer
became convinced that Harriet would never
thrive, mentally or physically, unless she were left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>free to follow her own bent. And perhaps he never
in his life made a wiser decision.</p>

<p>So he sent the wild girl to the home school of Mrs.
Charles Sedgwick of Lenox. Here she had the benefits
of cultured and elevating surroundings, together
with motherly care, and also of the out-of-door life so
dear to her heart and so necessary to her well-being.</p>

<p>Lenox, in the beautiful Berkshire Hills, was at that
time a primitive village, though it has since grown into
a fashionable summer resort. There, in Mrs. Sedgwick's
refined and peaceful home, Harriet acquired her
real education from listening to the conversations of
such men and women as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, Frederika Bremer and Fanny Kemble.</p>

<p>This stimulus was all Harriet needed to develop
in her the idea of doing some serious work in life.
She began to give a great deal of time to drawing,
her study of nature and her splendid powers of observation
being of great assistance to her here.</p>

<p>Those were happy days for Harriet. She was the
life of the household, being always ready to deliver
comic lectures, to dress up in odd costumes, to
give impromptu theatricals, or to say or do original
things. Mrs. Kemble, who occupied a villa
near the Sedgwicks, often entertained the school-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>girls
by reading and reciting Shakespeare to them.
Harriet became devotedly attached to her, their
friendship lasting throughout their lives.</p>

<p>In 1849, Harriet left Lenox and returned to Watertown
for the purpose of beginning her life work,
which she had decided should be that of a sculptor.
To work intelligently, it was necessary for her to
know anatomy thoroughly, but there was no college
where she could prepare herself in that study, for the
subject was at that time reserved strictly for men.</p>

<p>It happened that Harriet went to St. Louis to visit
friends, and that while she was there some lectures on
anatomy were delivered by Dr. J. N. McDowell, the
head of the medical department of the State University.
The lectures were not open to women, but so
great was Harriet's desire to profit by them that
Professor McDowell allowed her to see his notes and
examine the specimens by herself&mdash;a very radical
act on his part, since it was thought indelicate for a
woman to study this noble subject, even though the
knowledge was to be used to create the beautiful in
art and, so, to elevate public thought.</p>

<p>Harriet studied hard, and was rewarded at the
close of the term by receiving her diploma with the
class. This great concession had been gained through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>the influence of Mr. Wayman Crow, the father of
a classmate of Harriet. Mr. Crow became her intimate
friend and close adviser, watching over her
and guiding her affairs as long as he lived.</p>

<p>The coveted diploma secured, Miss Hosmer decided
to travel before returning home. She visited
New Orleans and traversed almost the entire length
of the Mississippi River. While on a Mississippi
steamboat, some young men began to talk of their
chances for reaching the top of a certain bluff which
they were then approaching. Miss Hosmer made a
wager that she could reach it before any of them.
The race was made, Miss Hosmer winning easily.
The bluff, about five hundred feet in height, was
straightway named Mount Hosmer.</p>

<p>In 1852 appeared her first finished product. This
was the bust of a beautiful maiden just falling asleep,
and was entitled <cite>Hesper, the Evening Star</cite>.</p>

<p>About this time Miss Hosmer met the renowned
actress, Charlotte Cushman. Miss Cushman, seeing
promise in the girl's work, urged her to go to Rome
and study. Dr. Hosmer approved of this suggestion,
and soon father and daughter sailed for Europe.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival in Rome, they called upon John
Gibson, the most noted English sculptor of the day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>to whom they had letters of introduction. After
examining the photographs of <cite>Hesper</cite>, and talking
with Harriet, who always impressed strangers with a
sense of her ability and earnestness, Gibson consented
to take her into his studio as a pupil.</p>

<p>Overjoyed was she to be assigned to a small room
formerly occupied by Canova, of whom Gibson had
been a pupil. Here she began the study of ancient
classical art, making copies of many masterpieces and
selling them without any trouble. When her first
large order for a statue came from her friend, Mr.
Wayman Crow, Harriet felt that she was beginning
the world in earnest. When this order was soon afterward
followed by another for a statue to be placed
in the Library at St. Louis, she knew that her career
as a sculptor was assured.</p>

<p>International fame came to her with a figure of
<cite>Puck</cite>, copies of which found their way into important
public galleries and into private collections on
both continents.</p>

<p>When the State of Missouri decided to erect its
first public monument, she was requested to design
a statue of Thomas H. Benton, to be cast in bronze
and placed in St. Louis.</p>

<p>A work attracting unusual attention was <em>Zenobia</em>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><em>Queen of Palmyra, in Chains</em>. A replica of this now
stands in the Metropolitan Museum, of New York
City. Miss Hosmer's whole soul was enlisted in her
work on this particular piece of sculpture. She spent
days searching the libraries for information upon
the subject, information that should stimulate her
hand to express powerfully her conception of the
great queen&mdash;dignified, imposing, and courageous,
despite her fallen fortunes. This statue was exhibited
in Rome, England and America.</p>

<p>Harriet Hosmer possessed a great faculty for inspiring
warm and lasting friendships. Among her
intimate friends during her long residence in Italy
were the Brownings, Mrs. Jameson, Sir Frederick
Leighton, and W. W. Story. The charming group
of artistic people living at that time in Rome, most
of them engaged in earnest work, occasionally took a
holiday in the form of a picnic or an excursion to
the Campagna. In one of her letters Mrs. Browning
speaks of these excursions, which had been instituted
by Fanny Kemble and her sister, Adelaide Sartoris:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Certainly they gave us some exquisite hours on the
Campagna with certain of their friends. Their talk was
almost too brilliant. I should mention, too, Miss Hosmer
(but she is better than a talker), the young American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>sculptress who is a great pet of mine and Robert's. She
lives here all alone (at twenty-two), works from six
o'clock in the morning till night as a great artist must,
and this with an absence of pretension and simplicity of
manners, which accord rather with the childish dimples
in her rosy cheeks, than with her broad forehead and
lofty aims.</p></div>

<p>Frances Power Cobbe wrote of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She was in those days the most bewitching sprite the
world ever saw. Never have I laughed so helplessly as
at the infinite fun of that bright Yankee girl. Even in
later years when we perforce grew a little graver, she
needed only to begin one of her descriptive stories to
make us all young again.</p></div>

<p>During five happy years, Charlotte Cushman,
Miss Hosmer and another friend made their home
together. In a letter to America, Harriet wrote:
"Miss Cushman is like a mother to me, and spoils
me utterly."</p>

<p>In 1862, Miss Hosmer received the news of her
father's death. Though grieving sincerely, she worked
but the more assiduously, to keep herself free of
selfish sorrow. By means of the moderate fortune
left her, she was able to take an apartment of her
own, and establish a studio which was considered
the most beautiful in Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>Here she entertained noted people of the day, who
came to visit her. Usually, after a hard day's work,
she would mount her horse and gallop over the Campagna,
returning refreshed at night and ready to dine
with her friends. Her animation and wit in discussion,
her musical laughter, her gaiety and lightness of spirits,
astonished and charmed all who met her.</p>

<p>Like most thinking women of the time, Harriet
Hosmer abhorred slavery, and did her part in the
Abolition movement by making an inspiring statue
called <em>The African Sibyl</em>&mdash;the figure of a negro
girl prophesying the freedom of her race. Of this
work, Tennyson said, "It is the most poetic rendering
in art of a great historical truth I have ever seen."</p>

<p>One of her notable orders came from the beautiful
Queen of Naples, whose portrait she executed in
marble. The Queen became a close friend of Miss
Hosmer, and her brother, King Ludwig <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> of Bavaria,
frequently visited the studio.</p>

<p>Miss Hosmer's last years were spent in England and
America, with only occasional visits to Rome. Death
came to her in 1908, at the age of seventy-eight, but
to the end she remained an entertaining talker, recalling
with joy the many episodes of her busy, happy
life and the great people she had known.</p>

<h2>LOUISA MAY ALCOTT</h2>

<p class="center">(1832-1888)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"God bless all good women! To their soft hands and pitying
hearts we must all come at last."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Oliver Wendell Holmes</em></p>
</div>


<p>The following is said to be a description of Louisa
May Alcott at the age of fifteen, written by herself
and published in her book called <cite>Little Women</cite>.
She is supposed to be <em>Jo</em>, and her three sisters were
the other <em>little women</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jo was very tall, thin and brown, and reminded one
of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with
her long limbs, which were very much in the way. She
had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp grey
eyes which appeared to see everything, and were by turns
fierce or funny or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was
her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net
to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, and big
hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the
uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly
shooting up into a woman and didn't like it.</p></div>

<p>Louisa May Alcott was born November 29th, 1832,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Her father was Amos
Bronson Alcott, a remarkable man, known as a
philosopher and educator. His views of education
differed from those of most people of his time,
though many of his ideas are highly thought of
to-day.</p>

<p>He became an important member of that circle of
great men of Concord known as Transcendentalists,
and he counted Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry
D. Thoreau among his closest friends.</p>

<p>Miss Alcott's mother was the daughter of Col.
Joseph May of Boston and the sister of the Rev.
Samuel J. May, a noted anti-slavery leader. Mrs.
Alcott was a quiet, unassuming woman, intellectual
in her tastes, and accustomed from her childhood to
the companionship of cultured people. Although
an excellent writer, both in prose and verse, her home
and her children were always her first thought. She
herself never became publicly known, but her influence
may be traced in the lives and works of her
brilliant daughter and gifted husband. It is doubtful
whether either could have achieved success without
her guidance and sympathy.</p>

<p>Thus Louisa came into the world blessed with a
heritage of culture and intellect. Her disposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>was sunny and cheerful. Upon one occasion, when
scarcely able to speak so as to be understood, she
suddenly exclaimed at the breakfast table, "I lub
everybody in dis whole world!"&mdash;an utterance that
gives the keynote to her character and nature.</p>

<p>When she was about two years of age, her parents
removed to Boston, where Mr. Alcott opened a school.
The journey was made by sea. Louisa liked steam-travel
so well that she undertook to investigate it
thoroughly. To the alarm of her parents, she disappeared,
being found after a search in the engine
room, sublimely unconscious of soiled clothes, and
deeply interested in the machinery.</p>

<p>Her father believed in play as an important means
of education, so Louisa and her sister were encouraged
in their games. Her doll was to her a real, live
baby, to be dressed and undressed regularly, punished
when naughty, praised and rewarded when
good. She made hats and gowns for it, pretended
it was ill, put it to bed, and sent for the doctor, just
as any other normal little girl does.</p>

<p>The family cat also came in for its share of attention
at the hands of Louisa. No one was allowed to
abuse or torment pussy, but the children might
"play baby" with her, and rock her to sleep; or they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>might play that she was sick and that she died, and
then attend her funeral.</p>

<p>All this sort of thing Mr. Alcott called "imitation,"
and at a time when many good parents looked disapprovingly
on children's sports, Mr. Alcott placed
them in his system of education. These plays were
so real to Louisa that she never forgot her joy in
them, and years afterward she gave them out delightfully
to other children in her stories.</p>

<p>At seven years of age she began, under her father's
direction, a daily journal. She would write down
the little happenings of her life, her opinions on current
events, on books she read, and the conversations
she heard. This was good training for the future
writer, developing the power of accurate thought and
of clear and charming expression.</p>

<p>In 1840, it became evident to Mr. Alcott that he
could not remain in Boston. His views on religion
and education were so much in advance of the people
about him that his school suffered. Concord had
long attracted the Alcott family, not only because it
was the home of Emerson and others of high intellectual
attainments, but because it offered a simple
life and rural surroundings. And so it came that
the family removed there, occupying a small house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>known as the Hosmer Cottage, about a mile from
Mr. Emerson's home.</p>

<p>At that time there were three Alcott children:
Anna, nine years of age, Louisa, eight, and Elizabeth,
five years. A boy, born in Boston, died early. A
fourth girl, named Abby May, was born in Hosmer
Cottage. These four sisters lived a happy life at
Concord, although the family had a hard struggle
with poverty; for Mr. Alcott, always a poor business
man, had lost the little he had in trying to form a
model colony, called Fruitlands.</p>

<p>But all were devoted to one another. The children
made merry over misfortune, and wooed good luck
by refusing to be discouraged. They were always
ready to help others, notwithstanding their own poverty.
Once, at their mother's suggestion, they carried
their breakfast to a starving family, and at
another time they contributed their entire dinner to
a neighbor who had been caught unprepared when
distinguished guests arrived unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Alcott first attempted to earn his living by
working in the fields for his neighbors, and by cultivating
his own acre of ground; but this work being
uncongenial, he soon drifted into his true sphere&mdash;that
of writing and lecturing. He supervised the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>instruction of all his children, but becoming convinced
of Louisa's exceptional ability, he took sole
charge of her education, and except for two brief
periods she was never permitted to attend school.</p>

<p>He was a peculiar man, this Mr. Alcott. One of
his methods of guiding his children was to write
letters to them instead of talking. The talks they
might forget, he said, but the letters they could
keep and read over frequently. Louisa had one
letter from him on <em>Conscience</em>, which helped to
mold her whole life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alcott, too, would sometimes write to Louisa,
giving her some advice or calling her attention to a
fault or undesirable habit. On Louisa's tenth birthday
her mother wrote her as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Daughter</span>:</p>

<p>Your tenth birthday has arrived. May it be a happy
one, and on each returning birthday may you feel new
strength and resolution to be gentle with sisters, obedient
to parents, loving to every one, and happy in yourself.</p>

<p>I give you the pencil case I promised, for I have observed
that you are fond of writing, and wish to encourage
the habit. Go on trying, dear, and each day it will be
easier to be and do good. You must help yourself, for the
cause of your little troubles is in yourself; and patience
and courage only will make you what mother prays to
see you, a good and happy girl.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>To another letter, received on her eleventh birthday,
Louisa replied by writing these verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">I hope that soon, dear mother.<br /></div>
 <div class="indent4">You and I may be<br /></div>
<div class="verse">In the quiet room my fancy<br /></div>
<div class="indent4">Has so often made for thee&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">The pleasant sunny chamber,<br /></div>
 <div class="indent4">The cushioned easy-chair,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">The book laid for your reading,<br /></div>
<div class="indent4">The vase of flowers fair;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">The desk beside the window<br /></div>
 <div class="indent4">When the sun shines warm and bright,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">And there in ease and quiet<br /></div>
<div class="indent4">The promised book you write</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">While I sit close behind you,<br /></div>
 <div class="indent4">Content at last to see<br /></div>
<div class="verse">That you can rest, dear mother,<br /></div>
<div class="indent4">And I can cherish thee.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Louisa very early took upon herself the task of
building up the family fortunes. When only fifteen,
she began teaching school in a barn. Among her pupils
were the children of Mr. Emerson. At this same
period we find her writing fairy stories which she sent
out to various editors. The editors promptly published
these stories, but they sent her no money for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>them. But money she must have, so, besides her
teaching, this enterprising girl took in sewing, which
brought her little, but was better than writing stories
for nothing! Louisa's intellect and ability did not
make her vain; she was not ashamed to do any kind
of honorable work.</p>

<p>Since the father proved a failure in supporting the
family, Mrs. Alcott tried to earn something by keeping
an intelligence office as an agent for the Overseers
of the Poor. One day a gentleman called who
wanted "an agreeable companion" for his father and
sister. The companion would be expected to do light
housework, he said, but she would be kindly treated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alcott could think of no one to fill the position.
Then Louisa said, "Mother, why couldn't I
go?"</p>

<p>She did go, remained two months, and was treated
very unkindly, being obliged to do the drudgery of
the entire household. After returning home, she
wrote a story that had a large sale, entitled <cite>How I
Went out to Service</cite>. Surely Louisa Alcott had the
ability to make the best of things, and to turn trials
into blessings.</p>

<p>At nineteen she developed great interest in the
theatre and straightway decided to become an ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>tress.
During her childhood she had written plays
which her sister Anna and a few other children
acted, to the amusement of the elder members of
the family. Now she dramatized her book, <cite>Rival
Prima Donnas</cite>, and prevailed upon a theatrical
manager to produce it. The man who had her play
in charge, however, neglected to fulfil his part of the
bargain, and meanwhile, Louisa's ardor for the theatre
cooled off.</p>

<p>By the time she was twenty-one, Miss Alcott
was fairly launched as an author. Two years later
she published a book, entitled <cite>Flower Fables</cite>, receiving
from its sale the astonishing sum of thirty-two
dollars. Then her work began to be accepted
by the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> and by other magazines of
good standing.</p>

<p>It was very difficult for her to write in Concord,
where she continually saw so much to be done at
home. When a book was in process of writing she
would go to Boston, hire a quiet room, and shut herself
in until the work was completed. Then she
would return to Concord to rest, "tired, hungry and
cross," as she expressed it. While in Boston she
worked cruelly hard, often writing fourteen hours out
of the twenty-four. Worn out in body, she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>grow discouraged and lose hope, wondering if she
would ever be able to earn enough money to support
her parents.</p>

<p>A dear and good friend of hers was the Reverend
Theodore Parker. At his home the tired, anxious
girl was certain to receive encouragement and cheer.
There she met Emerson, Sumner, Garrison, Julia
Ward Howe, and other eminent men and women of
the time. A few years before her death she wrote
to a friend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Theodore Parker and Ralph Emerson have done much
to help me see that one can shape life best by trying to
build up a strong and noble character through good books,
wise people's society, and by taking an interest in all the
reforms that help the world.</p></div>

<p>While in Boston Miss Alcott found time to go to
teach in an evening Charity School. In her diary
we find these jottings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I'll help, as I am helped, if I can.</p>

<p>Mother says no one is so poor that he can't do a little
for some one poorer yet.</p></div>

<p>At twenty-five years of age, Louisa Alcott was
receiving not over five, six, or ten dollars for her
stories. This would hardly support herself, to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>nothing of the family. Writing might be continued,
but sewing and teaching could not be dropped.</p>

<p>In 1861, when the Civil War broke out, her natural
love of action as well as her patriotism caused her to
offer her services as nurse. In December, 1862, she
went to Washington where she was given a post in the
Union Hospital at Georgetown. The Alcott family
had been full of courage until it was time for her to
depart. Then all broke down. Louisa herself felt
she was taking her life in her hands and that she
might never come back.</p>

<p>She said, "Shall I stay, Mother?"</p>

<p>"No, no, go! and the Lord be with you," replied her
mother, bravely smiling, and waving good-bye with a
wet handkerchief. So Louisa departed, depressed
in spirits and with forebodings of trouble.</p>

<p>She found the hospital small, poorly ventilated,
and crowded with patients. Her heart was equal
to the task, but her strength was not.</p>

<p>In her diary, she tells us the events of a day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Up at six, dress by gas light, run through my ward and
throw up the windows, though the men grumble and
shiver; but the air is bad enough to breed a pestilence.
Poke up the fire, add blankets, joke, coax, command; but
continue to open doors and windows as if life depended
upon it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
<p>Till noon I trot, trot, giving out rations, cutting up food
for helpless boys, washing faces, teaching my attendants
how beds are made, or floors are swept, dressing wounds,
dusting tables, sewing bandages, keeping my tray tidy,
rushing up and down after pillows, bed-linen, sponges,
books, and directions till it seems I would joyfully pay
all I possess for fifteen minutes' rest.</p>

<p>When dinner is over, some sleep, many read, and others
want letters written. This I like to do, for they put in
such odd things. The answering of letters from friends
after some one has died is the saddest and hardest duty a
nurse has to do.</p></div>

<p>After six weeks of nursing Miss Alcott fell seriously
ill with typhoid-pneumonia.</p>

<p>As she refused to leave her duties, a friend sent
word of her condition to her father, who came to the
hospital and took her back with him to Concord.
It was months before she recovered sufficiently even
to continue her literary work, and never again was
she robust in health. She writes: "I was never ill
before I went to the hospital, and I have never been
well since."</p>

<p>Her letters written home while she was nursing in
Georgetown contained very graphic and accurate descriptions
of hospital life. At the suggestion of her
mother and sisters, Miss Alcott revised and added
to these letters, making a book which she called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span><cite>Hospital Sketches</cite>. This book met with instant
success, and a part of the success was money.</p>

<p>After that, all was easy. There came requests
from magazine editors offering from two to three hundred
dollars for serials. Her place in the literary field
being now an assured thing, her natural fondness
for children led her to writing for them.</p>

<p>The series comprising <cite>Little Women</cite>, <cite>Jo's Boys</cite>, and
<cite>Little Men</cite>; together with <cite>An Old Fashioned Girl</cite>,
<cite>Eight Cousins</cite>, <cite>Rose in Bloom</cite>, <cite>Under the Lilacs</cite>, <cite>Jack
and Jill</cite>, and many others, are books dear to the
hearts of all children. Editions of all these books
were published in England, and in several other
European countries where translations had been
made of them,&mdash;all of which brought in large royalties
for the author.</p>

<p>What happiness it must have given her to make
her family independent, and to be able to travel!
Twice she visited Europe, the first time as companion
to an invalid woman, and a second time, after she
had earned enough to pay her own expenses.</p>

<p>Miss Alcott never married. When about twenty-five
years of age, an offer of marriage came to her
which most young women would have considered
very flattering. But she did not love her suitor, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>on her mother's advice, refused him, thus being saved
from that worst of conditions&mdash;a loveless union.</p>

<p>This first offer was not the last Miss Alcott received
and declined. Matrimony, she said, had no
charms for her! She loved her family, and her literary
work. Above all, she loved her freedom. Her
health was not benefited by her second trip to
Europe; excessive work had been too great a strain
upon her, and her father's failing health demanded
her constant care.</p>

<p>In 1877 Mrs. Alcott died, and in the autumn of
1882 Mr. Alcott had a stroke of paralysis. From
this he never fully recovered. Louisa was his constant
nurse, and it gave her great happiness to be able
to gratify his every wish. About this time Orchard
House, which had been the family home for twenty-five
years, was sold, and the family went to live with
Mrs. Pratt, the eldest daughter.</p>

<p>Hoping that an entire change of air and scene
might help her father, Miss Alcott rented a fine house
in Louisburg Square, Boston, to which she had him
removed. Here she showed him every attention,
until her own health became so impaired that she was
obliged to go to the home of Dr. Lawrence, at Roxbury,
for medical care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>A few days before her death, she was taken to see
her dying father. Shortly after her visit he passed
away, and three days later she followed him. Born
on her father's birthday, she died on the day he was
buried, March 6, 1888.</p>

<p>All her life Louisa Alcott labored to make others
happy, and she is still reaping her harvest of love the
world over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h2>FRANCES E. WILLARD</h2>

<p class="center">(1839-1898)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is a woman at the beginning of all great things."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Alphonse de Lamartine</em></p>
</div>


<p>It was not until 1873 that the vast amount of
drunkenness in our country attracted the attention
of the women of America.</p>

<p>A crusade was formed against it in the West, and
this led in 1874 to the foundation of the Women's
Christian Temperance Union. Frances Elizabeth
Willard was offered the position of president, an
honor she then declined, preferring to work in the
ranks; but four years later she yielded to the universal
demand, and accepted the chairmanship of this
great movement.</p>

<p>This able woman was born at Churchville, very
near Rochester, N. Y., on September 28, 1839. Her
father, of English descent, was a man of intellectual
force, brave, God-fearing; her mother, a woman of
strong religious feeling, great courage, and of fine
mental equipment. Frances inherited the best quali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>ties
of both parents. When she was two years of age,
the family removed to Oberlin, Ohio, and about five
years later to Janesville, Wisconsin, then almost a
wilderness. Here they lived the simple, hard life of
pioneers. Frances was at first taught by her mother
and a governess; afterward, she and her younger
sister entered the Northwestern College at Evanston,
from which Frances was graduated.</p>

<p>Mr. Willard removed to Evanston in order to be
near his daughters while they were in college, and in
1858 built a house there. Here the younger daughter
died, and later Mr. Willard, but Frances and her
mother continued to make it their home, even after
the death of the only son. Frances named it Rest
Cottage, and here she returned each year of her busy
life to spend two months with the mother whom she
had christened St. Courageous.</p>

<p>Idleness was an impossibility for Frances Willard.
After her graduation she taught in a little district
school, and from 1858 until 1868 continued the work
of teaching in various schools and colleges. In 1868
she went to Europe and spent two years in travel
and study. Upon her return she was elected President
of the Evanston College for Women, being the
first woman in the world to hold such a position.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>Two years later, when the college became a part of
the Northwestern University, Miss Willard became
Dean of the Women's College, but as some of her
views conflicted with those of the President, she soon
resigned the position.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the women of Ohio
began fighting the liquor traffic. To use Mrs. Livermore's
words, "Frances Willard caught the spirit of the
Woman's Crusade and believed herself called of God
to take up the temperance cause as her life work."</p>

<p>Every one, even her mother, opposed her, but feeling
herself called to the work she gave to it all her
energies of heart and soul.</p>

<p>When Miss Willard became President of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union in 1879, the
yearly income of the Union was only twelve hundred
dollars. The movement was too new and too strange
to command much understanding or sympathy from
the public; the work, so far, had been done without
system. Frances Willard at once began to put the
machinery in order: she organized bodies of workers
and lecturers; she instituted relief work and educative
centers; and the numbers of these she constantly
increased.</p>

<p>Perhaps Miss Willard's greatest moral asset was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>the power of winning followers. Many, many
women rallied enthusiastically to her support and
helped her to carry out her plans. To zeal and intelligence
she added charming manners and eloquence.
As a leader her ability was marvelous. Love came
to her from all sides because love went out from her
to everybody.</p>

<p>Her own love of the work was so great that for
years she labored without a salary, for the Union had
hard struggles to live even after Miss Willard undertook
the leadership of it. But with or without salary,
never did she spare herself.</p>

<p>It is said that during the first two years of her work
she delivered on an average one speech a day on temperance
and other reforms. She visited every town
in the United States of over ten thousand inhabitants
and most of those above five thousand.</p>

<p>The next step in Miss Willard's progress was a very
great one; no less a thing than the organization of
a World's Women's Christian Temperance Union!
Yes, this courageous and enterprising woman actually
planned to carry her crusade against strong drink
into every corner of the globe. At the Columbian
Exposition in Chicago in 1893 she was chosen Chairman
of the World's Temperance Convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lady Henry Somerset, a charming
and brilliant Englishwoman who had been working
in her own country to secure the same reforms Miss
Willard was pushing forward in America, came to
this country. It was her first visit&mdash;made, she
said, less to see America than to see Miss Willard,
and learn from her the principle upon which she had
founded the marvelous organization.</p>

<p>These two noble women became devoted friends,
and when, in the autumn of 1892, Lady Henry again
came to America to attend a National Convention
at Denver, she persuaded Miss Willard to return with
her to England. Our great temperance leader had a
fine reception from the English people, and won all
hearts by her gentleness and earnestness, as well as
by her remarkable gift of oratory.</p>

<p>Four years after this, the World's Women's Christian
Temperance Union held a Convention in London.
Every country in the civilized world sent delegates
to this meeting, over which Miss Willard and
Lady Somerset presided. These indefatigable world-workers
had secured a petition of seven million
names. It encircled the entire hall of the Convention,
and besides lay in large rolls on the platform.
This petition asked of all governments to have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>sale of intoxicating liquors and of opium restricted.
But, in spite of the seven million signatures and an
enormous enthusiasm, the sale of liquors and drugs
went on as before. Yet something was accomplished:
a great increase of sympathy in public opinion.</p>

<p>In addition to all these activities Miss Willard was
much engaged in literary work. She acted as editor
on various papers and magazines; also she wrote
several books, <cite>Nineteen Beautiful Years</cite>, <cite>Glimpses of
Fifty Years</cite>, <cite>Woman and Temperance</cite>, being the best
known.</p>

<p>When the White Cross and White Shield movements
for the promotion of social purity were formed,
Miss Willard, as leader, did a glorious work. Under
the white flag of the Women's Christian Temperance
Union with its famous motto, <em>For God, for Home and
Native Land</em>, she brought together, to work as sisters,
the women of the South and the North.</p>

<p>Miss Willard was always dignified, earnest, and
inspiring, but when talking on the subject so dear to
her heart she grew eloquent. As a presiding officer,
justice, tact, grace, and quick repartee made her the
ideal platform speaker, though, perhaps, courage
may be called her chief characteristic.</p>

<p>In later years, although suffering from ill health,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>she yet kept cheerfully at work and actually presided
over the Convention of 1897. This, however, proved
too great a strain, and on February 18, 1898, at the
Empire Hotel, New York City, she died. Her body
died, but her soul "goes marching on."</p>

<h2>WOMEN IN PIONEER LIFE AND
ON THE BATTLE-FIELD</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If we wish to know the political and moral condition of a
State, we must ask what rank women hold in it. Their influence
embraces the whole of life."</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<em>Aim&#233; Martin</em></p>
</div>


<p>The first foot that pressed Plymouth Rock was
that of Mary Chilton, a fair and delicate maiden,
and there followed her eighteen women who had
accompanied their husbands on the Mayflower to
the bleak, unknown shore of Massachusetts. Truly
the "spindle side" of the Puritan stock deserves
great admiration and respect.</p>

<p>These women came from a civilized land to a savage
one; from homes of plenty, where they had been
carefully guarded and tended, to a place where their
lives could be only danger, toil and privation. Often
they were obliged to pound corn for their bread, and
many were the times, their husbands being away
fighting the Indians, when they gathered their children
together, panic-stricken by the war whoops that
rang out from the wilderness near by. Little wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>that four of these eighteen women died during the first
winter, killed by cold, hunger, and mental anguish!</p>

<p>The early European settlers of America, both men
and women, were of a truly heroic breed. It was
spiritual as well as bodily courage they displayed&mdash;suffering
as they did for a religious principle. The
women often performed the duties of men, even
planting the crops in their husbands' absence, and
frequently using firearms to guard their children and
their homes. Shoulder to shoulder with the men
these women worked, and from the struggle was
evolved a new type&mdash;the woman of 1776, without
whose assistance the Revolutionary War could
scarcely have succeeded.</p>

<p>One of these women, who might have lived in luxury,
aloof from scenes of suffering, had she so wished,
stands out prominently. This was Martha Washington,
the wife of the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental
Army, who gathered the wives of the officers
around her at Valley Forge, during the severe winter
of 1777-78, and with them undertook the work of relieving
the needs of the soldiers. Under her leadership
the women gave up their embroidery, spinnet playing,
and other light accomplishments, and knitted stockings
and mittens, of which hundreds of pairs were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>distributed. We may regard her as the pioneer in a
form of work which later developed into Sanitary Commissions
and the great organization of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>A different type of woman was Moll Pitcher. She
showed her courage in quite another way. She was
the wife of John Hayes, a gunner. At that time, a
few married women, who found it easier to stand the
fearful strain of battle than to remain at home in
suspense, waiting for news of it, were allowed to
accompany their husbands to the battle-field,&mdash;not
to fight&mdash;oh, no, but to wash, and mend, and cook
for the men. Moll was one of these.</p>

<p>During the Battle of Monmouth, <em>Moll o' the
Pitcher</em>, as she was called, because of the stone pitcher
she used in carrying water to the soldiers, was engaged
in her usual work when she saw her husband
fall by the side of his gun. Running to him, she helped
him to a place of safety; then, at his request, she
returned to his gun. The commander was just
about to have it taken from the field, but as Moll
offered her services, he allowed it to remain. She
managed it so well that the report of her prowess
spread, even to the ears of General Washington.
The General called upon her to thank her, and the
Continental Congress gave her a sergeant's commis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>sion
and half-pay for life. "Captain Mollie," done
with military service, took her wounded husband
home and nursed him, but he died of his wounds
before the war closed.</p>

<p class="caption center p90">MOLLY PITCHER</p>
</div>

<p>Lydia Darrah, a Quakeress of Philadelphia, by her
quick wit and courage saved General Washington's
army from capture at Whitemarsh after the defeat
at Germantown. During the winter of 1777 the
British commander, General Howe, had his headquarters
in Second Street. Directly opposite dwelt
William and Lydia Darrah, strict Quakers whose
religion debarred them from taking sides in the war.
Because of this, perhaps, the British officers considered
their home a safe place for private meetings,
a large, rear room in the house being frequently used
for conferences with the staff-officers.</p>

<p>One evening, the Adjutant General told Lydia that
they would be there until late, but that he wished
the family to retire early, adding that, when the conference
was over he would call her to let them out
and put out the lights. Lydia obeyed, but could not
sleep. Her intuition told her that something of importance
to Washington was being discussed. Try
as she might to be neutral, as a Quaker should, her
sympathies were with the great General.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>At last she slipped from her bed, crept to the door
of the meeting-room, and listened at the keyhole.
She heard an order read for all British troops to
march out on the evening of December fourth to
capture Washington's army, which was then encamped
at Whitemarsh. Frightened and excited,
she returned to her room.</p>

<p>Not long after, the officer knocked at her door, but
she pretended to be asleep and did not answer. As
the knocking continued, she finally opened the door
and sleepily returned the officer's good night. Then
she locked up the house and put out the lights, but
spent the remainder of the night in thinking over
what she should do. Early next morning she told her
husband that their flour was all gone and she would
have to go to the mill at Franklin, five miles away,
to get more.</p>

<p>She presented herself at the British headquarters
bright and early, asking permission to pass through
the lines on a domestic errand. Permission was
granted, and she started for Franklin. She did not
stop there, however, but leaving her bag to be filled
ready for her upon her return, she continued walking
until she reached the American outposts. Asking
that she might speak to an officer, she told what she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>had heard, begging that she might not be betrayed.
Then she hastened back to the mill, secured her bag
of flour and returned home as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>And so it came about that, when the British
reached Whitemarsh, they found the American Army,
which they had planned to surprise, drawn up in
line awaiting battle. No battle took place; but the
British returned to Philadelphia, and there tried to
find out who had betrayed their plans. Lydia Darrah
was called up and questioned. She said that
the members of her family were all in bed at eight
o'clock on the night of the conference.</p>

<p>"It is strange," said the officer; "I know that you
were sound asleep, for I had to knock several times
to awaken you."</p>

<p>So the matter was dropped, and nobody knows to
this day whether the British ever learned the truth
or not.</p>

<p>The story of Emily Geiger's bravery has been told
in prose and poetry many times. It became necessary
for General Green to get reinforcements from
General Sumter. The latter was about fifty miles
away, and the country between them was overrun
with British soldiers. When Emily heard that General
Green needed a messenger for the dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>journey, she immediately offered her services. Well
she knew that discovery would mean being hanged for
a spy, but the risk did not appal her. Rather unwillingly
the General consented to her entreaties,
and entrusted the letter to her, telling her its contents
in case it should by any chance get lost. A
woman, he said, <em>might</em> run a chance of getting past
the British soldiers when a man would surely fail.</p>

<p>"I have a fleet horse," said Emily, "which I broke
and trained myself; I know the country and I am
sure I can get through." She dashed away, but
was captured on the second day and imprisoned in a
room of an old farm-house.</p>

<p>As soon as she was alone, she tore the letter up,
and chewed and swallowed the pieces. This was
done none too soon, for immediately afterward, a
woman entered and Emily had to submit to being
searched. Nothing of a suspicious nature being
found upon her, the British allowed her to go on.
Before sundown Emily reached General Sumter's
camp and delivered the message. As a result, after a
hard fought battle at Eutaw Springs, the British were
defeated by General Green. Emily Geiger married
happily and lived to a good old age. Long should
she be remembered for her courage and patriotism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>It is certain that at least one woman enlisted in the
Continental Army and fought as a soldier in the Revolutionary
War. This woman was Deborah Samson,
the daughter of poor parents of Plymouth County,
Massachusetts. She was but twenty-two years of age
when she left home, adopted male attire, and enlisted
under the name of Robert Shirtliffe.</p>

<p>A flaxen-haired girl was Deborah, with blue eyes
and rosy cheeks; she was not pretty, although as a
man she might have passed for handsome. Accustomed
from childhood to do farm work, she had
acquired the vigor and strength that enabled her to
perform the trying duties of military life. Deborah
saw something of real war. At White Plains she
received two bullet holes in her coat and one in her
cap; at Yorktown she went through a severe fight
but came out unhurt. Once she was shot in the
thigh, but fear of discovery exceeded the pain of the
wound, and she refused to go to the hospital. Later
she fell ill of brain fever, and in the hospital her sex
was discovered by the doctor. He did not betray her,
but as soon as her health permitted he had her removed
to his own house, where he gave her every care.</p>

<p>When her health was restored, the physician had a
conference with the Commander of the Regiment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>which "Robert" belonged. Soon there followed an
order to the young man to carry a letter to Washington.
Our young soldier felt very uneasy, but a
soldier must obey. In due time, she appeared before
General Washington. With great delicacy the
General said not a word to her regarding the letter
she had brought, but handed one, Robert Shirtliffe,
a discharge from the army, and a note containing
a few words of advice, with sufficient money to pay
her expenses until she could find a home.</p>

<p>Deborah then resumed woman's attire and returned
to her family. At the close of the war she
married Benjamin Gannet of Sharon. While Washington
was President, he invited Deborah to visit
the capital. She accepted, and during her stay there
Congress passed a bill granting her a pension for the
services she had rendered the country.</p>

<p>It has been stated, and is doubtless true, that
many women, disguised as men, enlisted during the
Civil War and served as soldiers. Others followed
the army as nurses, fighting when it became necessary.
Many of these women went because they
could not bear the separation from their husbands.
A notable example of this class was Madame Turchin,
wife of the Colonel of the Nineteenth Illinois. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>was the daughter of a Russian officer and had always
lived in foreign camps with her father. During the
War of the Rebellion, she accompanied her husband
to the battle-field and became a great favorite with
the soldiers under his command. To her the men
went when they were ill or in any trouble, knowing
they would always meet with sympathy, and when
necessary would be given careful nursing.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, when the regiment was actively
engaged in Tennessee, Col. Turchin fell ill,
having to be carried for several days in an ambulance.
His wife took the most tender care of him,
and also assumed his place at the head of the regiment,
even leading the troops into action. Officers
and men in the ranks alike obeyed her, for her
courage and skill equaled those of her husband. Without
faltering she faced the hottest fire. When her
husband recovered and again took command, she
retired to the rear and resumed the work of nursing
the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>Like Madame Turchin, Mrs. Kady Brownell had
been accustomed to camp life, her father having been
a soldier in the British Army. She married an officer
of the Fifth Rhode Island Infantry and accompanied
him to the front. She bore the regimental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>colors and marched with the men, asking no favors
and standing the brunt of battle fearlessly. A
fine shot was Mrs. Kady Brownell, also an expert
in the use of the sword. She was in General Burnside's
expedition to Roanoke Island and Newburn.
There her husband was so seriously wounded that
he was judged unfit for further service and given his
discharge. Mrs. Brownell asked for a discharge likewise,
and together they retired to private life.</p>

<p>Annie Etheridge of Michigan is said to have been
with the Third Michigan in every battle in which it
was engaged. When the three years of its service
was over, she followed the re-enlisted veterans to the
Fifth Michigan. Through the entire four years of
war, this fearless woman never left the field, though
often under the hottest fire. She made herself beloved
and respected by both officers and men.</p>

<p>Bridget Devins, known as "Michigan Bridget,"
because she went to the front with the First Michigan
Cavalry, in which her husband served as private,
was noted for her daring deeds and her good service.
When the troops were about to retreat, it was Michigan
Bridget who rallied them. When a soldier fell,
she took his place, fighting bravely in his stead.
Often she carried the wounded from the field, risking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>her own life in the performance of her duty. Michigan
Bridget liked military life so well that at the
close of the war she and her husband joined the
regular army and were sent to a station on the
western plains.</p>

<p>These women soldiers who served so bravely on the
field of battle, we must honor, yet we cannot regret
that their numbers were small. The nobler service
of those countless women, who, with white faces
and breaking hearts, sent to the front their husbands,
fathers and sons, can never be properly estimated
nor sufficiently honored.</p>

<p>These women toiled day and night, determined
that the soldiers should be well cared for and well fed;
they organized relief work so that the fighters might
have comforts and good hospitals. These women
as truly enlisted for battle as did the others who went
to the front.</p>
